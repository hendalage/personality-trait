dumbledore;i should've known that you would be here, professor mcgonagall. | i'm afraid so, professor. | the good and the bad. | hagrid is bringing him. | ah, professor, i would trust hagrid with my life. | no problems, i trust, hagrid? | albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? | the only family he has. | exactly. | he's far better off growing up away from all of that. | until he's ready. | there, there, hagrid. | it's not really goodbye, after all. | good luck...harry potter. | i have a few start-of-term notices i wish to announce. | the first years, please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. | also, our caretaker, mr. filch, has asked me to remind you that the third-floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. | thank you. | let the feast begin. | sillllleeennnnceeeee! |  everyone will please, not panic.  | now, prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories.  | teachers will follow me to the dungeons. | back again, harry? | i see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised.  | i trust by now you realize what it does.  | let me give you a clue.  | the happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is. | yes...and no.  | it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts.  | now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you.  | but remember this, harry.  | this mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth.  | men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad.  | that is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and i must ask you not to go looking for it again. | it does not do to dwell on dreams, harry, and forget to live. | good afternoon, harry.  | ah. tokens from your admirers? | what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.  | ah, i see your friend ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your chocolate frogs. | fine. they're both just fine. | relax, dear boy. the stone has been destroyed.  | my friend nicholas and i had a little chat and agreed it was best all around. | he has enough elixir to set his affairs in order.  | but yes, he will die. | ah. you see, only a person who wanted to find the stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it.  | that is one of my more brilliant ideas.  | and between you and me thats saying something. | ah, i'm afraid there are ways in which he can return.  | harry, do you know why professor quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? | it was because of your mother.  | she sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  | no, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. | it lives in your very skin. | love, harry, love.  | ah. bertie bott's every flavour beans.  | i was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then i have lost my liking for them.  | but i think i could be safe with a nice toffee... | mm. alas. earwax. | another year gone.  | and now, as i understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus.  | in fourth place, gryffindor with 312 points.  | third place, hufflepuff, with 352 points.  | in second place, ravenclaw, with 426 points | and in first place, with 472 points, slytherin house. | yes, yes, well done slytherin, well done slytherin.  | however, recent events must be taken into account.  | and i have a few last minute points to award.  | to miss hermione granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points.  | second, to mr. ronald weasley, for the best played game of chess that hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points.  | and third, to mr. harry potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, i award gryffindor house 60 points.  | and finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends.  | i award 10 points to neville longbottom. | assuming that my calculations are correct, i believe that a change of direction is in order.  | gryffindor wins the house cup! | they are not. | i am well aware of our bylaws having written quite a few of them myself. | however, as head of gryffindor house it is for professor mcgonagall to determine the appropriate action. | argus! | argus, i... | everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. | everyone except you three. | she's not dead, argus. | she has been petrified. | but how she has been petrified, i cannot say. | innocent until proven guilty, severus. | we will be able to cure her, argus. | as i understand it, madam sprout has a very healthy growth of mandrake. | when matured, a potion will be made which will revive mrs. norris. | and in the meantime i strongly recommend caution to all. | there's been another attack. | it means that our students are in great danger. | the truth. | tell them hogwarts is no longer safe. | it is as we feared, minerva | the chamber of secrets has indeed been opened again. | harry? | and about time too. | he's been looking dreadful for days. | pity you had to see him on a burning day. | fawkes is a phoenix, harry. | they burst into flame when it is time for them to die... | and then they are reborn from the ashes. | fascinating creatures, phoenixes. | they can carry immensely heavy loads. | their tears have healing powers. | hagriiid!! relax. | i do not believe that harry attacked anyone. | yes. | no, harry. i do not think it was you. | but i must ask you is there something you wish to tell me? | very well, then. | off you go. | riddle! come. | it is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, tom. | i'm afraid they are, tom. | they are true. | i understand, tom, but i'm afraid headmaster dippet may have no choice. | is there something you wish to tell me? | very well, then. off you go. | good evening, hagrid. | i wonder, could we...? | i want it understood, cornelius that hagrid has my full confidence. | well, what exactly is it that you want with me? | calm yourself, hagrid. | if the governors desire my removal i will, of course, step aside. | however you will find that help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it. | you both realize, of course that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules. | there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled. | therefore, it is only fitting that you both receive special awards for services to the school. | now, mr. weasley, if you would have an owl deliver these release papers to azkaban. | i believe we want our gamekeeper back. | harry, first, i want to thank you, harry. | you must have shown me real loyalty down in the chamber. | nothing but that could have called fawkes to you. | and second i sense that something is troubling you. | am i right, harry? | i see. | well, you can speak parseltongue, harry. why? | because lord voldemort can speak parseltongue. | if i'm not mistaken, harry he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar. | not intentionally but yes. | it's true. you possess many of the qualities that voldemort himself prizes. | determination, resourcefulness and if i may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. | why, then, did the sorting hat place you in gryffindor? | exactly, harry. exactly. | which makes you different from voldemort. | it is not our abilities that show what we truly are. | it is our choices. | if you want proof why you belong in gryffindor then i suggest you look more closely at this. | be careful. | it would take a true gryffindor to pull that out of the hat. | when the governors learned that arthur weasley's daughter was taken into the chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. | curiously, lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their family if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place. | beg your pardon? | yes. | voldemort. | only this time he chose to act through somebody else by means of this. | fortunately, our young mr. potter discovered it. | one hopes that no more of lord voldemort's old school-things should find their way into innocent hands. | the consequences for the one responsible would be severe. | before we begin the feast let us have a round of applause for professor sprout, madam pomfrey whose mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been petrified. | also, in light of the recent events as a school treat all exams have been canceled. | welcome! welcome to another year at hogwarts. | now, i'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. | first, i'm pleased to welcome professor r.j. lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of defense against the dark arts teacher. | good luck, professor. | our care of magical creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. | fortunately, i'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own rubeus hagrid. | finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the ministry of magic  | hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of azkaban until such a time as sirius black is captured. | the dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. | now whilst i've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution. | dementors are vicious creatures. | they'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. | therefore, i must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. | it is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. | but you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light. | mr. filch? round up the ghosts. | tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the fat lady. | keep moving! | dear lady, who did this to you? | secure the castle, mr. filch. | the rest of you, to the great hall. | thank you. | very good. | i didn't really expect him to linger. | quite remarkable, yes. | many. each as unlikely as the next. | not a single professor inside this castle would help sirius black enter it. | i'm quite convinced the castle is safe and i'm more than willing to send the students to their houses. | perhaps. but for now, let him sleep. | for in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own. | let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud. | aresto momentum! | no, minister. over this way. | that's ling you see over there... | on the slope... ah, hagrid. | good evening. | i'd like a cup of tea. | now, now, hagrid. now, come on. | all right. it'll be all right. | scabbers? | i do, miss granger. | but the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. | a child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. | mysterious thing, time. | powerful and when meddled with, dangerous. | sirius black is in the topmost cell of the dark tower. | you know the laws, miss granger | you must not be seen. | and you would do well, i feel, to return before this last chime. | if not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. | if you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared. | three turns should do it, i think. | oh, and by the way. | when in doubt, i find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. | good luck. | minister, i really think i should sign as well. | it's such a very long name... | here we are, minister. follow me. | now, look there. | look beyond the rocks. | professor dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster. | and all the strawberries. | over there. | over there. | all right. | how extraordinary. | i don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. | afterall, how could you? | you've been with us all the time. | well, search the skies, if you must, minister. | meanwhile, i'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. | oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. | thank you. | well? | did what? | good night.
mcgonagall;"good evening, professor dumbledore. | are the rumors true, albus? | and the boy? | do you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this? | i've watched them all day. | they're the worst sort of muggles, imaginable. | they really are... | this boy will be famous. | there won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name. | welcome to hogwarts. | now, in a few moments, you'll pass through these doors and join your classmates. | but before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. | they are gryffindor, hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin. | now, while you're here, your house will be like your family. | your triumphs will earn you points. | any rule-breaking, and you will lose points. | at the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup | the sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. | we're ready for you now. | follow me. | all right, will you wait along here, please? | now, before we begin professor dumbledore would like to say a few words. | when i call your name, you will come forth. | i shall place the sorting hat on your head and you will be sorted into your houses. | hermione granger. | draco malfoy. | susan bones. | ronald weasley. | harry potter. | your attention, please. | thank you for that assessment, mr weasley. | perhaps, lt'd be more useful if i were to transfigure mr. potter and yourself into a pocket-watch. | that way, one of you might be on time. | then perhaps a map? | i trust you don't need one to find your seats. | harry potter! | follow me. | you wait here. | professor quirrell, excuse me. | could i borrow wood for a moment please? | potter, this is oliver wood. | wood, i have found you a seeker. | oh! oh, my goodness!  | e-explain yourselves, both of you! |  ms. granger? | be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do.  | i would have expected more rational behaviour on your part and i am very disappointed in you ms. granger.  | 5 points will be taken from gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment.  | as for you two gentlemen i just hope you realize how fortunate you are.  | not many first year students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale.  | 5 points...will be awarded to each of you.  | for sheer dumb luck.  | good evening. | nothing, i repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night.  | therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken. | each. and to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention. | no, you heard me correctly, mr. malfoy.  | you see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours.  | you will join your classmates in detention. | i'm afraid professor dumbledore is not here.  | he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and left immediately for london. | how do you know? | i don't know how you three found out about the stone, but i can assure you it is perfectly well-protected.  | now would you go back to your dormitories? quietly.  | what are you talking about, mr. weasley? | not today, mr. weasley but i must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. | i will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention. | could i have your attention,please? | right. now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. | like so. | one, two, three. vera verto. | now it's your turn. | who would like to go first? | ahh , mr. weasley. | one, two, three. vera verto. | that wand needs replacing, mr. weasley. | yes, miss granger? | very well. | you all know, of course that hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: | godric gryffindor, | helga hufflepuff... | rowena ravenclaw | salazar slytherin. | now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. | one did not. | salazar slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts. | he believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. | in other words, pure-bloods. | unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. | now, according to legend slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle known as the chamber of secrets. | though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. | the heir alone would be able to open the chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who in slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic. | well , naturally, the school has been searched many times. | no such chamber has been found. | the chamber is said to be home to something that only the heir of slytherin can control. | it is said to be the home of a monster. | i think he's been petrified, madam pomfrey. | look. perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker. | what can this mean, albus? | what should i tell the staff? | this is out of my hands, potter. | professor dumbledore will be waiting for you. | sherbet lemon. | this match has been canceled. | silence, wood. you and your teammates will go to gryffindor tower. now. | potter, you and i will find mr. weasley. | there's something the both of you have to see. | i warn you. | this could be a wee bit of a shock. | she was found near the library along with this. | does it mean anything to either of you? | could i have your attention, please? | because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately: | all students will return to their house common rooms by 6:00 every evening. | all students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. | no exceptions. | i should tell you this: | unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught it is likely the school will be closed. | all students are to return to their house dormitories at once. | all teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately. | as you can see, the heir of slytherin has left another message. | our worst fear has been realized. | a student has been taken by the monster into the chamber itself. | the students must be sent home. | i'm afraid this is the end of hogwarts. | that's settled.  | we'll leave you to deal with the monster, gilderoy. | your skills, after all, are legend. | ginny weasley. | could i have your attention, please? | remember, these visits to hogsmeade village are a privilege. | should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again. | no permission form signed, no visiting the village. | that's the rule, potter. | i can't. only a parent or a guardian can sign. | since i am neither, it would be inappropriate. | i'm sorry, potter. | that's my final word. | cornelius! | professor dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place. | years ago, when harry potter's parents realized they were marked for death... | remember? they hid. | few knew where they were. | one who did was sirius black. | and he told you-know-who. | little lump of a boy. | always trailing after black. | peter tried to warn the potters and might have, had he not run into an old friend, sirius black. | yes, sirius black may not have put his hands to the potters but he's the reason they're dead. | this: sirius black was and remains to this day harry potter's godfather! | little lump of a boy. | always trailing after sirius black."
hagrid;"professor dumbledore, sir. | professor mcgonagall. | no, sir. | little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over bristol. | try not to wake him. | there you go. | sorry about that. | dry up, dursley, you great prune. | mind, i haven't seen you since you was a baby, harry. | but you're a bit more along than i would have expected. | particularly 'round the middle. | well, of course you are. | got something for you. | afraid i might have sat on it at somepoint, but i imagine it'll taste fine just the same. | baked it myself, words and all. | it's not every day that your young man turns 11, now is it? | rubeus hagrid, keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts. | of course, you know all about hogwarts. | no? blimey, harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all? | you're a wizard, harry. | a wizard. | and a thumping good one, i'd wager, once you're trained up little. | well, just harry, did you ever make anything happen? | anything you couldn't explain, when you were angry or scared? | a car crash?  | a car crash killed lily and james potter? | it's an outrage! | it's a scandal! | oh, and i suppose a great muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you? | non-magic folk. | this boy's had his name down ever since he were born. | he's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world and... | he'll be under the finest headmaster that hogwarts has ever seen, albus dumbledore. | never insult albus dumbledore in front of me. | oh, um, i'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at hogwarts about that. | strickly speaking, i'm not allowed to do magic. | ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. | best be off. | unless you'd rather stay, of course. | essential bit of equipment, harry. | they don't mean a penguin, do they? | crikey. i'd love a dragon. | vastly misunderstood beasts, harry. | vastly misunderstood. | if you know where to go. | no, thanks, tom. | i'm on official hogwarts business. | just helping young harry here buy his school supplies. | hello, professor. i didn't see you there. | harry, this is professor quirrell.  | he will be your defense against the dark arts teacher at hogwarts | yes, well, must be going now. | lots to buy. | see, harry? you're famous. | i'm not sure i'm exactly the right person to tell you that, harry. | welcome, harry, to diagon alley. | here's where you'll get your quills and your ink. | and over there, all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry. | well there's your money, harry. | gringotts, the wizard bank. | ain't no safer place, not one. | except perhaps hogwarts. | they're goblins, harry. | clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. | best stay close. | mr. harry potter wishes to make a withdrawal. | oh, wait a minute. | got it here somewhere. | ha! here's the little devil. | oh, and there's something else as well. | professor dumbledore gave me this. | it's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. | didn't think your mum and dad will leave you with nothing, now did ya? | can't tell you, harry. | hogwarts business. very secret. | best not to mention this to anyone, harry. | a wand? well, you'll want ollivanders. | there ain't no place better. | why don't you run along there and wait. |  i just got one more thing i gotta do. |  won't be long. | harry! harry! | happy birthday. | you all right, harry? | you seem very quiet. | first, and understand this harry because it's very important: | not all wizards are good. | some of them go bad. | a few years ago there was a one wizard who went as bad as he can go. |  his name was v... | his name was v... | no, i can't spell it. | all right, voldemort. | it was dark times, harry. dark times. | voldemort started to gather some followers. | brought them over to the dark side. | anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. | your parents fought against him. | but nobody lived once he decided to kill them. | nobody, not one. | except you. | yes. that ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, harry. | a mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that. | well, some say he died. | codswallop, in my opinion. | nope, i reckon he's out there still too tired to carry on. | but one thing's absolutely certain.  | something about you stumped him that night. | that's why you're famous. | that's why everybody knows your name. | you're the boy who lived. | what are you looking at? | blimey, is that the time? | sorry, harry, i'm gonna have to leave you. | dumbledore will be wanting his... | well, he'll be wanting to see me. | now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. | here's your ticket.  | stick to it, harry that's very important.  | stick to your ticket. | right, then. | first years, this way, please! | come on, now, first years, don't be shy. | come on now, hurry up. | hello, harry. | right, then. this way to the boats. | come on, now, follow me. | well done! | what's going on with harry's broomstick? | go go go! | looks like he's gonna be sick. | yes! | nonsense.  | why would snape put a curse on harry's broom? | who told you 'bout fluffy? |  well, of course he's got a name.  | he's mine.  | i bought him off an irish feller i met down at the pub last year.  | then i lent him to dumbledore to guard the | shouldn'ta said that.  no more questions! | don't ask any more questions.  | that's top secret, that is. | codswallop.  | professor snape is a hogwarts teacher. | now, you listen to me, all three of you.  | you're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in.  | it's dangerous. | what that dog is guarding is strictly between professor dumbledore and nicholas flamel. | i shouldn't have said that.  | i should not have said that.  | i should not have said that.  | oh, hello. sorry, don't wish to be rude, but i'm in no fit state to entertain today.  | oh. | snape? blimey, harry, you're not still on about him, are you? | snape is one of the teachers protecting the stone!  | he's not about to steal it! | you heard. right.  | come on, now, i'm a bit preoccupied today. | that's right.  | waste of bloody time, if you ask me. | ain't no one gonna get past fluffy.  | hehe, not a soul knows how.  | except for me and dumbledore.  | i shouldn't have told you that.  | i shouldn't have told you that.  | oh! ooh! ooh! ooh! ooh!  | that? it's a ... its um... | i won it. off a stranger i met down at a pub.  | seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact. | isn't he beautiful? oh. bless him, look.  | he knows his mummy. hehe.  | hallo, norbert. | yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he? | don't you, norbert? dededede. | ohh! oooh, ooh, ooh, well... | he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.  | who's that? | oh, dear. | norbert's gone. | dumbledore sent him off to romania to live in a colony. | yeah, but what if he don't like romania?  | what if the other dragons are mean to him? | he's only a baby, after all. | right. let's go. | what we're here for.  | see that? that's unicorn's blood, that is.  | i found one dead a few weeks ago.  | now, this one's been injured bad by something.  | so, it's our job to find the poor beast.  | ron, hermione, you'll come with me. | and harry you'll go with malfoy.  | fine. just so you know, he's a bloody coward. } | hello there, firenze.  | i see you've met our young mr. potter.  | you all right there, harry?  | i don't know.  | i never saw his face.  | he kept his hood up. | well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures i looked after.  | i told him. i said, ""after fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."" |  well, of course he was interested in fluffy! |  how often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade?  | but i told him. i said, ""the trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. |  take fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."" |   i shouldn't have told you that. |  where you going?! wait! | yes! | come on now, hurry up. you'll be late.  | train's leaving.  | go on. go on. come on. hurry up. | thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja?  | this is for you. | oh. go on...on with you.  | oh, listen, harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his. | i do. but your cousin don't, do he? eh? off you go. |  harry? | what do you think you're doing down here? come on. | you're a mess, harry.  | skulking around knockturn alley?  | dodgy place. | don't want no one to see you there. | people will think you're up to no good. | me? i was...  | i was looking for flesh-eating slug repellent. | they're ruining all the school cabbages. | hello, hermione. | you'll be all right now then, harry? | right. i'll leave you to it. | this calls for a specialist's equipment. | nothing to do but wait till it stops, i'm afraid. | okay. | better out than in. | who was ron trying to curse, anyway? | he did not. | see, the thing is, harry, there are some wizards, like the malfoy family...who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood. | and it's codswallop to boot. | dirty blood. | why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half-blood or less. | more to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our hermione can't do. | come here. | don't you think on it, hermione. | don't you think on it for one minute. | blimey! harry's got himself a rogue bludger. | that's been tampered with, that has. | broken? there's no bones left. | professor dumbledore, sir! | wait! listen! | professor dumbledore, sir, it wasn't harry. | i'd be prepared to swear it in front of the ministry of magic. | of course you don't. | ohh! oww! right. well, i'll... | i'll just wait outside, then. | let's get you out of there. | you can't. you don't understand. | it wasn't him. | aragog never killed no one. never. | no! | no! | aragog! aragog! | mad and hairy? you wouldn't be talking about me, now, would you? | it's flesh-eating slug repellent. | for the mandrakes, you know. | now, according to professor sprout, they've still got a bit of growing to do. | but once their acne's cleared up, we'll chop them up and stew them. and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-petrified. | in the meantime, though, you three had best be looking after yourselves. | all right? | hello, neville. | who's there? | hello? hello? | nothing. i was expecting... it doesn't matter. come on in. | i just made a pot of tea. | i'm fine. i'm all right. | oh yeah. i heard about that, all right. | what you had to understand about that is... | quick, under the cloak. | don't say a word. | be quiet, both of you. | professor dumbledore, sir. | of course. come in. come in. | but i never... | you know i never, professor. | take me? take me where? | not azkaban prison. | what are you doing here? | get out of my house! | you can't take professor dumbledore away. | take him away and the muggle-borns won't stand a chance. | you mark my words, there'll be killings next! | well? if... | if anybody was looking for some stuff then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. | yep. that would lead them right. | that's all i have to say. | and someone will need to feed fang while i'm away. | sorry i'm late. | the owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. | some ruddy bird called errol. | and i'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, harry and ron and hermione, of course i would still be you-know-where so i'd just like to say thanks. | that's it. come on, now. come closer. | less talking, if you don't mind. | i got a real treat for you today. | a great lesson. so follow me. | right, you lot. less chattering. | form a group over there. | and open your books to page 49. | just stroke the spine, of course. | goodness me. | that, ron, is a hippogriff. | first thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures. | very easily offended. | you do not want to insult a hippogriff. | it may be the last thing you ever do. | now, who'd like to come and say hello? | well done, harry. well done. | come on now. | now you have to let him make the first move.  | it's only polite. so step up. give him a nice bow. | then you wait and see if he bows back. | if he does, you can go and touch him. | if not... well, we'll get to that later. | just make your bow. | nice and low. | back off, harry. back off. | keep still. keep still. | well done, harry. well done. | here, you big brute, you. | right. i think you can go and pat him now. | go on. don't be shy. | nice and slow, now. | nice and slow. slow. | not so fast, harry. | slow down, harry. that's it... | nice and slow. | now let him come to you. | slowly, now, slowly, slowly... | that's it…yes! | well done! well done, harry, | well done! | i think he may let you ride him now. | come on. | put you over here, just behind the wing joint.  | don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that. | well done, harry, and well done, buckbeak. | well done, well done. | how am i doing me first day? | malfoy, no... | no! | buckbeak! | whoa, whoa, whoa... | whoa! buckbeak! | away, you silly creature... | calm down. it's just a scratch! | i'm the teacher. i'll do it. | class dismissed! | allow me, minister. | sorry about that. | well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there. | i got up and did my piece. | said how buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. | and then lucius malfoy got up. | well, you can imagine. | he said buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you. | and then he asked for the worst, did old lucius. | no, i'm not sacked. | buckbeak's been sentenced to death! | look at him. loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them. | they'd know it was me, and then dumbledore would get into trouble. | he's coming down, dumbledore. | says he wants to be with me when they...when it happens. | great man, dumbledore. | a great man. | you'll do no such thing! | think i want you seeing something like that? no. | you just drink your tea and be off. | oh. before you do, ron... | keep a closer eye on your pet. | blimey. what was that? | oh, crikey. | it's late. it's nearly dark. | you shouldn't be here. | someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble. | particularly you, harry. | with you in a moment! | quick. quick! | go on, go on! | professor dumbledore. | minister. make your way through. | have a tea, if you like. | gentlemen. | dear, dear... | buckbeak didn't mean no harm. | keep a closer eye on your pet. | buckbeak. | right. | you'll find no small glasses in this house, professor."

 | you knew all along and you never told me? | blown up? | you told me my parents died in a car crash. | muggle? | okay. | first year's students will require three sets of plain work robes one wand. | one pair of dragon hide gloves. | hagrid, do they mean from a real dragon? | you'd like a dragon? | all students must be equipped with one standard size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat or a toad. | can we find all this in london? | oh, nice to meet you. | goodbye. | but why am i famous, hagrid? | all those people back there, how is it they know who i am? | but, hagrid, how am i to pay for all this? | i haven't any money. | hagrid, what exactly are these things? | what's in there, hagrid? | i still need... a wand. | hello? | hello? | sorry, but what's curious? | and who owned that wand? | he killed my parents, didn't he? | the one who gave me this. | you know, hagrid.  | i know you do. | maybe if you wrote it down? | voldemort? | me? voldemort tried to kill me? | what happened to v...? | to you-know-who? | platform 9 3/4? | but, hagrid, there must be a mistake. | this says platform 9 3/4. | there's no such thing, is there? | excuse me. excuse me. | excuse me sir, can you tell me where i might find platform 9 3/4? | muggles? | excuse me. | could you tell me how to...? | no. not at all. | i'm harry. harry potter. | the what? | we'll take the lot. | bertie bott's every flavor beans? | these aren't real frogs, are they? | i've got dumbledore! | hey, he's gone! | just a little bit. | yeah. | hey, hagrid. | i think i can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks. | nothing. nothing, i'm fine. | not slytherin, not slytherin! | say, percy, who's that teacher talking to professor quirrell? | what's he teach? | i think she fancies you. | we got lost. | i don't know, sir. | i don't know, sir. | clearly, hermione knows. | seems a pity not to ask her. | what's seamus trying to do to that glass of water? | can i borrow this? thanks. | hey ron! somebody broke into gringotts. | listen. | believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown gringotts goblins while acknowledging the breach, insist nothing was taken. | the vault in question, number 713, had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day."" | that's odd.  | that's the vault hagrid and i went to. | give it here, malfoy. | give it here or i'll knock you off your broom! | a century, according to mcgonagall. | but i've never even played quidditch.  | what if i make a fool of myself? | i-i didn't know. | who doesn't? | what's happening? | let's go this way. | let's go. | run! quick, let's hide through that door! | it's locked! | and for good reason.  | guarding something? | i think so.  | what are those? | what was that? | i like this ball. | what do i do with it? | whoa. | i think we're going to need another feather over here, professor. | i think she heard you. | where's hermione? | how could a troll get in? | hermione!  | she doesn't know! | it's going into the girl's bathroom! | hermione, move! | whooa! whoa, whoa!  | do something! | anything!  | hurry up! | i don't think so.  | just knocked out.  |  ew. troll bogies. | good of you to get us out of trouble like that. | mind you, she might not have needed saving if you hadn't insulted her. | i'm not hungry. | that explains the blood. | listen, last night, i'm guessing snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog.  | but, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping. | the day i was at gringotts, hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. |  he said it was hogwarts' business, very secret. | that's what the dog's guarding.  | that's what snape wants. | but i-i never get mail. | it's a broomstick! | but who...? | a little. | what happened? | yes! whoa! | yes! | whoa! whooa! | who knows.  | why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on halloween? | yes? | but hagrid, whatever fluffy's guarding, snape's trying to steal it! | exactly. | nicholas flamel? | nicholas flamel...who's nicholas flamel? | knight to e-5. | happy christmas, ron.  | what are you wearing? | i've got presents? | oh!  | your father left this in my possession before he died. | it is time it was returned to you. | use it well. | some kind of...cloak. | my body's gone! | i'm invisible?? | there was no name.  | it just said, ""use it well."" | famous fire eaters... | 15th century fiends...flamel... | nicholas flamel...where are you? | mum? dad?  | ron! you've really got to see this!  | ron! you've got to see this!  | ron, ron, come on. get out of bed! | there's something you've got to see.  | now, come on! | come on. come. come look, it's my parents! | look in properly. go on.  | stand there. there.  | you see them, don't you?  | thats my dad | how can it?  | both my parents are dead. | no. | no. | so, then it shows us what we want?  | whatever we want? | malfoy. | i found him! | go on! | i knew the name sound familiar. | i read it on the train that day. |  shh! | hagrid! | we think snape's trying to steal it. | hagrid, we know he's after the stone.  | we just don't know why. | what? | wait a minute. | one of the teachers? | uh, hagrid, what exactly is that? | norbert? | malfoy. | hagrid always wanted a dragon.  | he told me so the first time i met him. | i don't understand.  | 50?! |  hagrid, what's that? | if i didn't know better, draco, i'd say you were scared. | what is it, fang? | but what was that thing you saved me from? | but who would choose such a life? |  do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn... | that was drinking its blood...that was voldemort? | the sorcerer's stone. | but he's weak.  | he's living off the unicorns.  | don't you see? we had it wrong.  | snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for voldemort.  | with the elixir of life, voldemort will be strong again.  | he'll he'll come back.  |  i think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight. | my scar. it keeps burning. | not like this. |  i think it's a warning. |  it means dangers coming. uhh!   | oh. of course! | don't you think it's a bit odd that what hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? | i mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets?  | why didn't i see it before?  | hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? |  what did he look like? | the stranger, though, you and he must have talked. |  and did he seem interested in fluffy? |  we have to see professor dumbledore, immediately! | he's gone?! now?  | but this is important!  | it's about...the sorcerer's stone. | someone's going to try and steal it. | that was no stranger hagrid met in the village.  | it was snape, which means he knows how to get past fluffy. | we go down the trapdoor. tonight. | trevor. | now, neville, listen. we were |  let's go. sorry. | snoring | snape's already been here.  | he's put a spell on the harp. | we have to move its paw. | come on! okay. push!  | i'll go first.  | don't follow until i give you a sign. | if something bad happens, get yourselves out… | does it seem a bit...quiet to you? | jump! go!  | whoa! oh. ahh! | hermione! where are you?! | yeah, yeah, i'm fine. | apparently not. | what? | ron, are you okay? | okay. | lucky hermione pays attention in herbology. | i don't know.  | sounds like wings. | they're not birds, they're keys.  | and i'll bet one of them fits that door.  | i don't know. strange. | there! i see it! | the one with the broken wing! | it's too simple. | catch the key! | where are we? a graveyard. | there's the door. | wait a minute. | no, ron! no! | he's going to sacrifice himself! | ron!  | no! don't move! dont forget, we're still playing.  | checkmate.  | take care of ron. then, go to the owlery.  | send a message to dumbledore.  | ron's right...i have to go on. | not as good as you. | you? no. it can't be...snape. he was the one | b-but, that day, during the quidditch match, snape tried to kill me. | snape was trying to...save me? | th-then you let the troll in. | i-i'm shaking hands with dumbledore.  | i've won the house cup. | voldemort. | never! | you liar! | ahhhhhhhhh! | admirers? | ron was here?  | is he all right?  | what about hermione? | but, what happened to the stone? | but flamel, he'll die, won't he? | how is it i got the stone, sir?  | one minute i was staring in the mirror, and the next... | does that mean, with the stone gone, i mean, that voldemort can never come back? | what is it? | all right there, ron? | all right. hermione? | good job. | one minute.  | thanks, hagrid.  | but hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from hogwarts. you know that. | i'm not going home. not really. | i can’t let you out, hedwig.  | i’m not allowed to use magic outside of school.  | besides, if uncle vernon… | now you’ve done it. | but she’s bored!  | if i could only let out for an hour or two | but i haven’t had any messages from any of my friends... not one… all summer. | i’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that i don’t exist. | who are you? | not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom. | why don’t you sit down? | dobby, ssh! i’m sorry!  | i didn’t mean to offend you, or anything. | you can’t have met many decent wizards then. | stop, dobby! | dobby, shh! | dobby, please stop! | stop! stop, dobby.  | please be quiet!  | are you all right? | your family? | what terrible things?  | who’s plotting them? | ok– i- understand. you can’t- say. | dobby! dobby, put the lamp down. | give me the lamp! dobby stop! | get in there, and keep quiet! | i- i was just— | sorry. | yes, sir... see why i’ve got to go back?  | i don’t belong here.  | i belong in your world, at hogwarts.  | it’s the only place i’ve got friends! | well, i expect they’ve... been- hang on-  | how do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me? | give me those, now! | dobby, get back here! | dobby, please, no! | i can’t. hogwarts is my home! | ron! fred. george.  | what are you all doing here? | ahh- ahh! | let go of me! | get off! | i think it’s brilliant | hello. w-what did i do? | raids? | oh, sorry sir. i’m harry, sir, harry potter. | oh, umm... | floo powder? | diagonally. | i'm fine, thank you. i was just going... |  no. please... | hagrid! | i was lost, i... | hang on. | what were you doing down there then? | it's great to see you too. | i definitely need to remember that one. | thank you. bye. | voldemort killed my parents. | he was nothing more than a murderer. | let's go. | sorry. | lost control of the trolley. | why can't we get through? | the train leaves at exactly 11:00. | we've missed it. | maybe we should just go and wait by the car. | ron, i should tell you most muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car. | come on, then. let's go lower. | we need to find the train. | all we need to do is catch up with the train. | do you hear that? | hold on. | i'm trying. your hand's all sweaty. | i think we found the train. | up! up! | up! ron, mind that tree! | be thankful it's not your neck. | i don't know. | come on, go! fast! | see you, hedwig. | so a house-elf shows up in my bedroom we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4... | we almost get killed by a tree... | clearly someone doesn't want me here this year. | professor dumbledore. | professor mcgonagall. | you're doomed. | hi, colin. nice to meet you. | stop. hold still! | malfoy? | no, colin, get out of the way. | let's take him to hagrid's. | he'll know what to do. | malfoy. he called hermione... | well, i don't know exactly what it means. | what's a mudblood? | that's horrible. | not really. | what? | that voice. | didn't you hear it? | spooky. | did you hear it? | that voice. | i heard it first in lockhart's office. | and then again just... | it's moving. | i think it's going to kill. | strange. | i've never seen spiders act like that. | oh, no. | it's filch's cat. | it's mrs. norris. | no. no. | it's not true, sir. i swear. | i never touched mrs. norris. | when i said i wasn't hungry. | we were heading back to the common room when we found mrs. norris. | strange? | do you think i should have told them? | dumbledore and the others, i mean? | if there really is a chamber of secrets, and it has been opened, that means...  | maybe ron's right, hermione. | i mean, look at his family. | the whole lot of them have been in slytherin for centuries. | how long will it take to make? | a month? | but, hermione, | if malfoy is the heir of slytherin he could attack half the muggle-borns in the school by then. | wood, look out! | thank you. | no. i think my arm is broken. | no, not you. | dobby? | it was you.  | you stopped the barrier from letting ron and me through. | you nearly got ron and me expelled. | your bludger? you made that bludger chase after me? | you better clear off before my bones come back dobby, or i might strangle you. | i don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me? | why do you wear that thing, dobby? | repeat itself? you mean this has happened before? | stop it! | stop it, dobby! | tell me dobby when did this happen before? | who's doing it now? | no, dobby. tell me. | who is it? | thank you, sir. | you wish. | rictusempra! | i'm a what? | i know. i accidentally set a python on my cousin dudley at the zoo once. | once. but so what? | i bet loads of people here can do it. | what's bad? if i hadn't told that snake not to attack justin... | you were there. you heard me. | i spoke a different language? | but i didn't realize... | how can i speak a language without knowing i can? | but i'm not. | i can't be. | i'll see you back in the common room. | no. mr. filch! you don't understand... | professor i swear i didn't. | professor dumbledore? | i...i..i was just wondering if you put me in the right house. | you're wrong. | professor. | your bird...there was nothing i could do. | he just caught fire. | you don't think it was me, professor? | no, sir. nothing | crabbe and goyle. | ron, maybe i should do it. | wingardium leviosa. | come on, let's get them. | ron. | we still sound like ourselves. | you need to sound more like crabbe. | excellent. | hermione, are you okay? | come on. | i think the slytherin common room's this way. | i'm... | ah- um.. reading. | you're wrong! | harry potter? | but then you must have some idea who's behind it all. | it's his stomachache. | calm down. | hair! | hermione, come out. | we've got loads to tell you. | hermione? | are you okay? | she should be out of hospital in a few days when she stops coughing up fur balls. | what's this? | looks like moaning myrtle's flooded the bathroom. | why would i throw something at you? | but who threw it at you, anyway? | ""tom marvolo riddle."" | my name is harry potter. | do you know anything about the chamber of secrets? | can you tell me? | excuse me.  | could you tell me what's going on here? | are you tom riddle? | hello, can you hear me? | dumbledore? | hagrid! | haagriiid! | wow! | it was hagrid.  | hagrid opened the chamber of secrets 50 years ago. | the monster had killed somebody, ron. | what would any of us have done? | what's that you've got, hagrid? | and they found it. | tom riddle's diary is gone. | no. | we've got to talk to hagrid, ron. | i can't believe it's him but if he did set the monster loose last time he'll know how to get inside the chamber of secrets. that's a start. | i think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again. | what's that for? | hagrid, are you okay? | did you hear about hermione? | look, we have to ask you something. | do you know who's opened the chamber of secrets? | look. | come on. | come on, fang. | come on. | you heard what hagrid said. | follow the spiders. | shush! | come on. | don't panic. | we're friends of hagrid's. | and you? | you're aragog, aren't you? | he's in trouble. up at the school, there have been attacks. | they think it's hagrid. | they think he opened the chamber of secrets. like before. | then you're not the monster? | but if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago? | but have you seen it? | what? | well, thank you. | we'll just go. | one, but it's not powerful enough for all of them. | let's go! | arania exumai! | go! | arania exumai! | don't mention it. | get us out of here. | now! | come on! | come on, move faster! | come on! go! | get us in the air. | come on! pull! | we know one thing. | hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets. | he was innocent. | wish you were here, hermione. | we need you. | now more than ever. | ron... | this is why hermione was in the library the day she was attacked. | come on. | of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land none is more deadly than the basilisk. | capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. | spiders flee before it. | ron, this is it. | the monster in the chamber of secrets is a basilisk. | that's why i can hear it speak. | it's a snake. | because no one did look it in the eye. | not directly, at least. | colin saw it through his camera. | justin... justin must have seen the basilisk through nearly headless nick. | nick got the full blast of it. | but he's a ghost, he couldn't die again. | and hermione had the mirror. | i bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along. | the water. | there was water on the floor that night. | she only saw the basilisk's reflection. | spiders flee before it. | it all fits. | hermione's answered that too. | remember what aragog said about that girl 50 years ago? | she died in a bathroom? | what if she never left? | lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the chamber. | at least we can tell him what we know. | professor, we have some information for you. | are you going somewhere? | you're running away? | after all you did in your books? | you wrote them. | you're a fraud. | you've been taking credit for what other wizards have done. | don't even think about it. | to ask you how you died. | who was it, myrtle? | just like that? how? | this is it. | this is it, ron. i think this is the entrance to the chamber of secrets. | yes, there is. | you first. | all right. let's go. | thanks, myrtle. | now, remember: any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway. | this way. | it's a snake skin. | ron! ron, are you okay? | you wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. | i'll go on and find ginny. | ginny! ginny, please don't be dead. | wake up, wake up. | please wake up. | tom. tom riddle. | what do you mean, she won't wake? | she's not...? | are you a ghost? | she's cold as ice. | ginny, please don't be dead. wake up. | you've got to help me, tom. | there's a basilisk. | give me my wand, tom. | we've got to go. we've got to save her. | no. she couldn't. she wouldn't. | but why? | and why did you want to meet me? | hagrid's my friend. | and you framed him, didn't you? | i'll bet dumbledore saw right through you. | well, you haven't finished it this time. | in a few hours, the mandrake draught will be ready. | and everyone who was petrified will be all right again. | why do you care how i escaped? | voldemort was after your time. | you. you're the heir of slytherin. | you're voldemort. | albus dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world. | he'll never be gone.  | not as long as those who remain are loyal to him. | fawkes? | ginny? | ginny? | don't worry. | ginny, you need to get yourself out. | follow the chamber and you'll find ron. | you were brilliant, fawkes. | i just wasn't quick enough. | of course. | phoenix tears have healing powers. | thanks. | it's all right, ginny. | it's over. | it's just a memory. | it's just... | you see, sir, i couldn't help but notice certain things, certain... | certain similarities between tom riddle and me. | voldemort transferred some of his powers to me? | so the sorting hat was right. | i should be in slytherin. | because i asked it to. | godric gryffindor. | dobby. | so this is your master. | the family you serve is the malfoys. | don't worry. i will be. | sir? i wonder if i could have that? | mr. malfoy. | mr. malfoy! | i have something of yours. | i think you do, sir. | i think you slipped the diary into ginny weasley's cauldron that day at diagon alley. | open it. | just promise me something. | never try to save my life again. | we had loads of help from you. | we couldn't have done it without you. | there's no hogwarts without you, hagrid. | lumos maxima... | lumos maxima... | lumos maxima... | lumos... maxima! | uncle vernon. i need you to sign this form. | nothing. school stuff | i will if she does. | yes. | okay. | oh, yeah. | yeah. i've been beaten loads of times. | that's a lie. | my dad wasn't a drunk. | shut up! shut up! | no. she deserved what she got. | keep away from me. | yeah? try me. | i don't care. | anywhere is better than here. | i fell over. | i didn't do it on purpose. | nothing. | i didn't. | he leaky cauldron. that's in london. | but the muggles. can't they see us? | who is that? that man. | how did he escape? | yeah. him i've heard of. | hedwig. | no, thank you. minister? | i don't understand. | i broke the law. underage wizards can't use magic at home. | the state of things, sir? | sirius black, you mean? | but what's he got to do with me? | hedwig. | egypt. what's it like? | mrs. weasley. | good to see you too. | yes. | it's all upstairs. | everything. | thank you. | mr. weasley. | yeah, sure. | yeah. it should be great. | has this anything to do with sirius black, sir? | only that he's escaped from azkaban. | voldemort. | sorry. | and kill me. | mr. weasley why would i go looking for someone who wants to kill me? | i didn't mean to blow her up. i just...i lost control. | i was lucky not to be arrested actually. | do you think he's really asleep? | i gotta tell you something. | yeah. | thanks, ron. | i don't know. | maybe we've broken down. | thank you. | what was that thing that came? | what happened to me? | and did either of you two you know pass out? | but someone was screaming. | a woman. | how did he find out? | fortuna major. | fortuna major. | thank you. | still doing that after three years. | she can't even sing. | hey, man. | shut up, malfoy. | what? | hey, hey, hey! | brilliant, professor. | at least hagrid didn't get fired. | i thought if you signed it, then i could... | forget about it, guys. see you later. | professor, can i ask you something? | i did think of voldemort at first. | but then i remembered that night on the train and the dementor. | before i fainted i heard something. | a woman screaming. | i think it was my mother the night she was murdered. | haunted building in britain. i know. | what's going on? | excuse me, sir. | where's professor lupin? | it's quidditch tomorrow. | probably a right sight better than he normally does. | oh, brilliant. | what happened? | really? i meant the match. who won? | no. | professor, why do the dementors affect me so? | i mean, more than everyone else? | i'm scared, professor. | i need to know how to fight them. | you could teach me. | you made the one on the train go away. | but you made it go away. | guys, let me go. | i'm trying to get to hogsmeade. | let me go! come on, guys. don't... | what are you doing?! | what's this rubbish? | messrs. moony, wormtail, padfoot and prongs are proud to present the marauder's map. | hang on. this is hogwarts. and that… | no. is that really...? | so you mean this map shows... | everyone? | brilliant! where did you get it? | he was their friend and he betrayed them. | he was their friend! | i hope he finds me. | because when he does, i'm gonna be ready! | when he does, i'm gonna kill him! | i'm sure. | yes. | expecto patronum. | shall we? wand at the ready. | expecto patronum! | expecto... expecto...expect... | that's one nasty dementor. | the first time i rode a broom. | there's another. | it's not happy, exactly. | well, it is. | it's the happiest i've ever felt but it's complicated. | just do it. | expecto patronum! | expecto patronum! | i think i've had enough for today. | i was thinking of him. and mum. | seeing their faces. | they were talking to me. | just talking. | that's the memory i chose. | i don't even know if it's real. | but it's the best i have. | ripped to pieces? | what are you talking about? | tell those spiders. | sorry. | mischief managed. nox. | i was sleepwalking. | my dad didn't strut. and nor do i. | if you don't mind, i would appreciate it if you could lower your wand. | spare bit of parchment. | messrs. moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs offer their compliments to professor snape and... | and request he keep his large nose out of other people's business. | no, sir. | yes, sir. | professor, just so you know, i don't think that map always works. | earlier, it showed someone in the castle. | someone i know to be dead. | peter pettigrew. | it's just what i saw. | good night, professor. | hang on. | we better take this back. | fine. see you later. | professor trelawney... | sorry? | no. nothing. | why don't we just set him free? | hagrid! | hagrid. | it'll be fine. it'll be okay. | what? | oh, no. | ron! | wait! | that's not good. ron, run! | ron! ron, wait! | ron! | ron. ron. | come on! | move! | don't worry. | i have a hunch. | i just hope i'm wrong. | come on. | ron. | the dog. where is it? | then it'll be you! | i know why. | you betrayed my parents. | you're the reason they're dead! | who was it, then? | expelliarmus! | tell me about peter. | no. pettigrew's dead. you killed him! | the map was lying, then. | all they could find of pettigrew was his... | show me. | give it to him, ron. | no! | i know what he is. | but we'll take him to the castle. | get off! | i said we'd take you to the castle. | after that, the dementors can have you. | okay. | no. don't worry, okay? | it's fine. i'll stay. | you okay? | i didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers. | besides, dead, the truth dies with him. | alive, you're free. | i know. | what? come and live with you? | expelliarmus! | come on. | sirius! | sirius! | no. sirius! | expecto patronum! | i saw my dad. | he sent the dementors away. | i saw him across the lake. | they're gonna kill him? | it's true sir. sirius is innocent. | what just happened? | where's ron? | i don't know. going to hagrid's? | hermione! | hermione! hermione, wait. | hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing? | that's us. | this is not normal. | you mean we've gone back in time? | good punch. | come on. we should be at hagrid's. | look. buckbeak's still alive. | here they come. i'd better hurry. | that's pettigrew. | hermione that's the he betrayed my parents. | you don't expect me to sit here. | are you mad? | that hurt. | what? | get away. get off. | okay, buckbeak. come quickly.  | come with us now. come on. | buckbeak. okay? | quickly. hurry up. okay? | hurry up now, buckbeak, okay? | this way. | this way. | this way, now. | now what? | how? | and now we wait. | yeah. | hermione? | before, down by the lake, when i was with sirius i did see someone. | that someone made the dementors go away. | it was my dad. | it was my dad conjured the patronus. | dead. i know. | i'm just telling you what i saw. | you see sirius talking to me there? | he's asking me to come live with him. | when we free him, i'll never have to go back to the dursleys'. | it'll just be me and him. | we could live in the country someplace you can see the sky. | he'll like that after all those years in azkaban. | let's go. | what are you doing? | thanks. | great. now he's coming for us. | poor professor lupin's having a really tough night. | sirius. come on! | don't worry. | my dad will come. | he'll conjure the patronus. | any minute now. | right there. you'll see. | don't worry, he will. | he will come. | sirius. | expecto patronum! | you were right, hermione. | it wasn't my dad i saw earlier. it was me! | i saw myself conjuring the patronus before. | i knew i could do it this time because well, i had already done it. | does that make sense? | i want to go with you. | but you're innocent. | my mother's eyes. | he's free. we did it. | i don't know. | honestly, ron. how can somebody be in two places at once? | you've been sacked. | resigned? why? | but dumbledore... | none of it made any difference. | pettigrew escaped. | what are you talking about? | for me? | but who sent it? | lumos. | i solemnly swear that i am up to no good. | mischief managed. | nox."

ollivander;i wondered when i'd be seeing you, mr. potter. | it seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. | here we are. | give it a wave. | apparently not. | perhaps… this | no, no, definitely not. | no matter. | i wonder.. curious. | very curious. | i remember every wand i've ever sold, mr. potter. | it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. | just one other. | it is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar.  | we do not speak his name. | the wand chooses the wizard, mr. potter. | it's not always clear why. | but i think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. | after all, he-who-must-not-be-named did great things. | terrible yes, but great

| i'll be right back. | wanna play chess? | wanna go and visit hagrid? | harry, i know what you're thinking, but don't. | there's something not right about that mirror. | i'm ready. ask me any question. | i forgot. | copy off you. | that's insulting!  | it's as if they don't trust us! dumbledore again! | leg-locker curse? | you have got to start standing up to people, neville. | dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945. | for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon blood...and his work on alchemy with his partner, nicholas flamel! | this is light? | immortal? |  i know what it means! |  i know what that is!  | but hagrid, how did you get one? | that's not just a dragon.  | that's a norwegian ridgeback!  | my brother charlie works with these in romania. | it's crazy.  | and worse, malfoy knows. | it's bad. | okay. | but if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you? |  and to think, i've been worrying about my potions final! | speak for yourself. |  all right there, harry? | perhaps you should see the nurse. | trevor shh! | go, you shouldn't be here! | you're a little scary sometimes...you know that?  | brilliant, but scary. | it's for your own good, you know. | sorry. | wait a minute...he's....  | uh. it's got horrible breath! | what?! | ew! yuck! ugh.  | ahh! whoa.  | lucky this plant-thing is here, really. | kill us faster?!  | oh, now i can relax! | now what are we gonna do?! | ahh! harry! | harry! | help! | help! help me! | help! | ahhh! | yeah. | whew. lucky we didn't panic! | alohomora!  | well, it was worth a try. | we're looking for a big old fashioned one.  | probably rusty like the handle. | oh, go on, harry!  | if snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can!  | you're the youngest seeker in a century! | this complicates things a bit! | hurry up! | this is no graveyard.  | it's a chessboard. |  it's obvious, isn't it?  | we've got to play our way across the room.  | all right. harry, you take the empty bishop's square.  | hermione, you'll be the queen's side castle.  | as for me, i'll be a knight. | well, white moves first, and then...we play.  | you there! d-5!  | yes, hermione, i think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess! | castle to e-4!   | pawn to c-3! | you understand right, harry.  | once i make my move, the queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the king. | do you want to stop snape from getting that stone or not? | harry, it's you that has to go on. i know it.  | not me, not hermione, you.  | knight...to h-3. | check. | ahhhh! | all right? you? | hi, harry! | rescuing you, of course.  | now, come on. get your trunk!... | you’d better stand back. let’s go! | come on. | come on, harry! hurry up! | i’ve got you harry! | drive! | by the way, harry, happy birthday! | do you think it’d be all right if we had some of this? | it’s not much, but it’s home. | they were starving him, mum.  | there were bars on his window! | ginny. she’s been talking about you all summer. |  a bit annoying really. | dad works in the ministry of magic, in the misuse of muggle artifacts office.  | dad loves muggles, thinks they’re fascinating. | he’s always doing that. | but harry's never traveled by floo powder before, mum. | diagon alley. | mum fancies him. | i don't know. | the gateway has sealed itself for some reason. | harry, if we can't get through maybe mum and dad can't get back. | the car. | aaa, right. | oh, no! the invisibility booster must be faulty. | okay. | we can't be far behind. | we must be getting close. | haaaarryyy! | hold oonnn!!! | take my hand! | hold on! | yeah. | welcome home. | it's not working! | stop! stop! stop! | my wand. look at my wand. | what's happening? | scabbers, you're okay. | the caaaar! | dad's gonna kill me. | honestly, professor snape, i think it did more damage to us. | we'll go and get our stuff, then. | you're going to expel us, aren't you? | say it. i'm doomed. | bloody bird's a menace. | what do we do now? | i smell trouble. | those are nimbus 2001 s. | how did you get those? | you'll pay for that one, malfoy. | eat slugs! | it's disgusting. | hear what? | kill? | i don't like spiders. | what's that? | are you mad? | vera verto! | three guesses who. | do you think it's true? |  do you think there really is a chamber of secrets? | let's think.  | who do we know who thinks all muggle-borns are scum? | of course. you heard him. | you'll be next, mudbloods. | crabbe and goyle must know. | maybe we could trick them into telling. | you mean if harry and i drink that stuff, we'll turn into crabbe and goyle? | wicked! malfoy will tell us anything. | i'll stop it. | of course. | don't you see? | lucius malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. | now he's taught draco how to do it. | enlighten me. why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight in the middle of the girls' lavatory? | don't you think we'll get caught? | why? | who? | who's moaning myrtle? | who cares? | you're a parselmouth? | why didn't you tell us? | that's what you said to it. | i heard you speaking parseltongue. | snake language. | exactly. | now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson. | how? | whose hair are you ripping out, then? | yeah. right. | how thick could you get? | essence of crabbe. | i think i'm gonna be sick. | harry? | bloody hell! | bloody hell. | but where's hermione? | what are you doing d...? | i mean, what are you doing down here? | stomachache. | scar! | that was close. | look at your tail. | have you spoken to hermione? | yuck! | but it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. | i mean, it'll just go right through you. | we don't even know this tom riddle. | he sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch. | that would be a cheerful visit. | hello, hagrid. tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately? | whoever it was, they must have been looking for something. | hermione! | but you heard mcgonagall. | we're not allowed to leave the tower except for class. | that's dad's boss. | cornelius fudge, minister of magic. | hagrid's right. | with dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day. | what? | they're heading to the dark forest. | why spiders? why couldn't it be ""follow the butterflies""? | harry, i don't like this. | harry, i don't like this at all. | can we go back now? | harry. | harry! | can we panic now? | know any spells? | where's hermione when you need her? | glad we're out of there. | thanks for that. | the flying gear's jammed! | i'm trying! | follow the spiders! | follow the spiders. | if hagrid ever gets out of azkaban, i'll kill him. | i mean, what was the point of sending us in there? | what have we found out? | what's that? | but if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead? | and mrs. norris? | i'm pretty sure she didn't havea camera or a mirror, harry. | how's a basilisk been getting around? | a dirty, great snake. | someone would have seen it. | pipes? it's using the plumbing. | moaning myrtle. | her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever. | ginny. | what about my sister? | you're the defense against the dark arts teacher.  | you can't go now. | is there anything you can do? | say something.  | harry say something in parseltongue! | better you than us. | go on. | what's this? | bloody hell. | whatever shed this must be 60 feet long. or more. | heart of a lion, this one. | harry! harry | i'm fine. | ron weasley. | lockhart's memory charm backfired. | he hasn't got a clue who he is. | no. | what do i do now? | okay. | thanks, sir. | welcome back, hermione. | i'm warning you, hermione. | keep that beast away from scabbers, or i'll turn it into a tea cozy. | a cat? is that what they told you? | looks like a pig with hair. | harry. | brilliant. loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even scabbers enjoyed himself. | along with the dung beetle. | i haven't shown anyone. | brilliant. | i still think it was brilliant. | who do you think that is? | do you know everything? | how is it she knows everything? | oh. | let me get this straight. | sirius black escaped from azkaban to come after you? | sure. | except no one's ever broken out of azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic. | what's going on? | there's something moving out there. | i think someone's coming aboard. | bloody hell! what's happening? | well, you sort of went rigid. | we thought maybe you were having a fit or something. | no. | i felt weird, though. | like i'd never be cheerful again. | shove off, malfoy. | green. that's a monkey. | what is that? | do not give him one again. | hey, neville, try an elephant. | i will. | oh, don't try one of them. | look at him. his face. | where did you come from? | sure. | yeah. | harry's got sort of a wonky cross. | that's trials and suffering. | and that there could be the sun and that's happiness. | so you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it. | you don't think that grim thing's got anything to do with sirius black? | ancient runes? exactly how many classes are you taking? | hang on. that's not possible. | ancient runes is in the same time as divination. | you have to be in two classes at once. | you're supposed to stroke it. | hagrid, exactly what is that? | listen to the idiot. | he's really laying it on thick, isn't he? | who? | when did she get here? | riddikulus! | honeyduke's sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats zonko's joke shop. | we never got to go to the shrieking shack. | you heard it's the most... | probably neville forgot the password again. | oh, you're there. | serves her right. | she was a terrible singer. | werewolves? | when did she come in? | did you see her come in? | he's got a point, you know. | he looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? | well, you fell off your broom. | there's something else you should know too. | when you fell, your broom sort of blew into the whomping willow, and...well... | twice. | actually, i'm fine here. | shut your mouth, malfoy. | what's up, malfoy? lost your skis? | bloody hell, harry. | that was not funny. | those weasels! never told me about any marauder's map. | sure. along with his invisibility cloak. | that's not true! | thick heads. | merry christmas. | gorgeous. | unless you've been ripped to pieces! | i haven't lost anything! | your cat killed him! | harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about. | and scabbers is gone. | your cat killed him! | did. | they're not sacking you! | spiders! there's... there's spiders. | spiders. they want me to tap-dance. | i don't wanna tap-dance! | right, yeah. tell them. i'll tell them... | she's gone mental, hermione has. | i mean, not that she wasn't always mental but now it's in the open for everyone to see. | i'm not going back. | see you. | it just got worse. | hermione, no! | he's not worth it. | not good, brilliant. | scabbers! you're alive! | right. next time i see crookshanks, i'll let him know. | let's go! | he bit me. scabbers. | scabbers, come back. | scabbers, you bit me! | harry, hermione, run! | it's the grim! | ah! harry! | harry!help! | it's a trap. he's the dog. | he's an animagus. | harry! what did you just do? | me?! he's mental! | scabbers has been in my family for... | so what? | what are you trying to do to him? | scabbers! | leave him alone! get off him! | what are you doing? | a bit? a bit? | you almost tore my leg off! | you better go. | i'm fine. go. | so painful. | they might chop it. | it's too late. it's ruined. | it'll have to be chopped off. | hermione! bad idea. bad idea. | nice doggy. nice doggy! | it's scabbers who did it. | he's my rat, sir. | he's not really a rat. he was a rat. | he was my brother percy's rat. | but then they gave him an owl... | what the bloody hell was that all about? | hermione, no! he's not worth it. | not good, brilliant. | scabbers, you're alive! | let's go. | how did you get there? | i was talking to you there. | and now you're there. | stand back, i said! or i'll take it upstairs if you don't settle. | quiet. | let the man through. | i didn't mean to open it, harry. | it was badly wrapped. | they made me do it. | no one knows."
woman;anything off the trolley, dears?
hermione;"has anyone seen a toad? | a boy named neville's lost one | oh, are you doing magic? | let's see, then. | are you sure that's a real spell? | well, it's not very good, is it? | of course, i've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me. | for example: | oculus reparo. | that's better, isn't it? | holy cricket, you're harry potter! | i'm hermione granger. | and you are...? | pleasure. | you two better change into robes. | i expect we'll be arriving soon. | you've got dirt on your nose, by the way. | did you know? | just there. | it's not real, the ceiling.  | it's just bewitched to look like the night sky. | i read about it in hogwarts: a history. | oh, no. okay, relax. | nearly headless? | how can you be nearly headless? | i've read about those. | when the smoke turns red, it means you've forgotten something. | up. up. up! | harry, no way! | you heard what madam hooch said. | besides, you don't even know how to fly. | what an idiot. | you won't make a fool of yourself.  | it's in your blood. | the staircases change, remember? | we're not supposed to be here.  | this is the 3rd floor.  | it's forbidden. | oh, move over!  | alohomora | get in | standard book of spells, chapter 7. | filch is gone. |  it was locked. |  you don't use your eyes, do you?  | didn't you see what it was standing on? | it was standing on a trap door.  | which means it wasn't there by accident.  | it's guarding something. | that's right.  | now, if you two don't mind, i'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! | stop, stop, stop. | you're going to take someone's eye out.  | besides, youre saying it wrong.  | it's leviosa, not leviosar. | wingardium leviosa. | help! help! | ahhh! help! | swish and flick! | is it...dead? | it's my fault, professor mcgonagall.  | i went looking for the troll.  | i'd read about them and thought i could handle it.  | but i was wrong.  | if harry and ron hadn't come and found me... | i'd probably be dead. | ron's right, harry.  | you're gonna need your strength today. | blood? |  but why would anyone go near that dog? | so you're saying... | bit early for mail, isn't it? | it's snape!  | he's jinxing the broom! | leave it to me.  | lacarnum inflamarae. | whoo-hoo! | that thing has a name? | hogwarts teacher or not, i know a curse when i see one.  | i've read all about them.  | you have to keep eye contact.  | and snape wasn't blinking. | i don't know. | that's totally barbaric! | see you haven't. | good. you can help harry, then.  | he's going to go the library for information on nicholas flamel. | not in the restricted section... | happy christmas. | look at you, playing with your cards. | pathetic! | we've got final exams coming up soon. | alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients in a forgetfulness potion? | follow me! | i had you looking in the wrong section!  | how could i be so stupid?  | i checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading. | of course! here it is!  | nicholas flamel is the only known maker of the philosopher's stone! | honestly, don't you two read?  | the philosopher's stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers.  | it will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the elixir of life, which will make the drinker immortal. | it means you'll never die. | the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr. nicholas flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday! | that's what fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor.  | that's what's under the trapdoor... | the philosopher's stone! | of course! there are other things defending the stone, aren't there? | spells and enchantments. | is that...a dragon? | is that bad? | well, that's good, isn't it?  | he'll be with his own kind. | harry! | you mean, you-know-who's out there, right now, in the forest? | hang on a minute. | we're forgetting one thing.  | who's the one wizard voldemort always feared? |  dumbledore!  | as long as dumbledore's around, you're safe.  | as long as dumbledore's around, you can't be touched.  |  i've always heard hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but i found that rather enjoyable. | it's happened before. |  what is it? |  and with dumbledore gone | uh...we were just... | now what do we do? |  neville, i'm really, really sorry about this |  petrificus totalus. | sorry. | ow! you stood on my foot! | alohomora. | the harp. it stopped playing. | stop moving, both of you.  | this is devil's snare.  | you have to relax.  | if you don't, it will only kill you faster. | just relax! | do what i say. trust me.  | are you okay? | he's not relaxing, is he? | we've got to do something! | uh! i remember reading something in herbology.  | um devil's snare, devil's scare,it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun!  | that's it! devil's snare hates sunlight! | lumus solem! | what is that? | curious. i've never seen birds like these. | what's this all about? | ugh! what're we going to do?  | there must be 1000 keys up there! | what's wrong, harry? | i don't like this.  | i don't like this at all. | now what do we do? | what happens now? | ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you? |  what is it? | no, ron, you can't! | there must be another way! | you'll be okay, harry.  | you're a great wizard, you really are. | me? books and cleverness?  | there are more important things.  | friendship, and bravery.  | and harry, just be careful. | never better. | we're tied with slytherin! | come on, harry. | feels strange to be going home, doesn't it? | harry. hagrid. | it's so good to see you. | what did you do to your glasses? | oculus reparo. | okay, bye. | come on, everyone's been so worried. | fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. | mandrake, or mandragora is used to return those who have been petrified to their original state. | it's also quite dangerous.  | the mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it. | get off me! | immobulus! | at least no one on the gryffindor team had to buy their way in. | they got in on pure talent. | you okay, ron? | say something. | he called me a mudblood. | it means ""dirty blood. | mudblood's a foul name for someone who's muggle-born. | someone with non-magic parents. | someone like me. | it's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation. | harry! | voice? what voice? | harry, wait! not so fast! | the chamber of secrets has been opened. 
enemies of the heir, beware. | enemies of the heir, beware. | it's written in blood. | that's why ron and i went looking for him, professor. | we'd just found him when he said... | it's a bit strange, isn't it? | you hear this voice, a voice only you can hear... | and then mrs. norris turns up petrified. it's just strange. | no, harry. even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign. | professor i was wondering if you could tell us about the chamber of secrets. | muggle-borns. | professor? what exactly does legend tell us lies within the chamber? | yes. couldn't you tell?  | mcgonagall's worried.  | all the teachers are. | the heir of slytherin has returned to hogwarts.  | the question is, who is it? | if you're talking about malfoy... | i heard him. | but malfoy, the heir of slytherin? | even they aren't that thick. | but there might be another way. | mind you, it would be difficult. | not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules... | and it'll be dangerous. | very dangerous. | here it is. | the polyjuice potion. | properly brewed, the polyjuice potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another. | yes  | exactly. | but it's tricky.  | i've never seen a more complicated potion. | a month. | i know. | but it's the only plan we've got. | no! even with a proper wand, it's too risky. | you could hit harry. | let's go. | finite incantatem! | are you okay? | you will be able to, won't you? | again? you mean the chamber of secrets has been opened before? | maybe. | we'll have to wait for the polyjuice potion to know for sure. | no. no one ever comes in here. | moaning myrtle. | moaning myrtle. | she's a little sensitive. | do you think he's all right? | you can talk to snakes. | no, they can't. | it's not a very common gift, harry. | this is bad. | i don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something. | harry, listen to me. | there's a reason the symbol of slytherin house is a serpent. | salazar slytherin was a parselmouth. | he could talk to snakes too. | he lived a thousand years ago. | for all we know, you could be. | everything's set.  | we just need a bit of who you're changing into. | we also need to make sure that the real crabbe and goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating malfoy. | i've got it all worked out. | i filled these with a simple sleeping draught. | simple, but powerful. | now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs and put on their uniforms. | i've already got mine. | millicent bulstrode. slytherin. | i got this off her robes. | i'm going to go check on the polyjuice potion. | make sure that crabbe and goyle find these. | we'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves. | add the hairs. | cheers. | me too. | i...i don't think i'm going. | you go on without me. | just go. you're wasting time. | go away. | do you remember me telling you that the polyjuice potion was only for human transformations? | it was cat hair i plucked off millicent bulstrode's robes. | look at my face. | it can't be hagrid. | it just can't be. | look, hagrid's our friend.  | why don't we just go and ask him about it? | it had to be a gryffindor. | nobody else knows our password. | unless it wasn't a student. | thanks, sir nicholas. | it's good to be back. | congratulations. | i can't believe you solved it. | thanks. | oh, no. | it's a cat, ronald. | what do you expect? | it's in his nature. | that's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. | crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy. | harry. | egyptians used to worship cats. | good morning, mr. weasley. | honestly, ron, it's not funny. | harry was lucky not to be expelled. | come on. everywhere else is full | professor r.j. lupin. | it's on his suitcase, ronald. | seems to be. why? | but they'll catch black, won't they? | i mean, everyone's looking for him. | why are we stopping? | we can't be there yet. | ouch, ron. that was my foot. | harry. | harry, are you all right? | no one was screaming, harry. | of course. that's why he knew to give you the chocolate, harry. | just forget it. | that's awful. | what a load of rubbish. | me? | i've been here all this time. | oh, honestly, ron. if you ask me, divination's a woolly discipline. | now, ancient runes, that's a fascinating subject. | a fair few. | don't be silly. how could anyone be in two classes at once? | broaden your minds. use your inner eye to see the future. | i think they're funny. | just ignore him. | tah- tah- tah- dah! isn't he beautiful? | say hello to buckbeak. | that was wicked, harry! | hagrid! he has to be taken to the hospital. | i hear draco's father's furious. | we haven't heard the end of this. | dufftown? that's not far from here. | no one knows. | boggarts are shape-shifters. | they take the shape of whatever a person fears the most. | that's what makes them so... | it's not funny, ron. | sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. | we're not meant to start that for weeks. | please, sir. | an animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. | a werewolf has no choice. | with each full moon he no longer remembers who he is. | he'd kill his best friend. | furthermore, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind. | go, harry! go, harry! | how are you feeling? | no one blames you, harry. | dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. dumbledore's furious. | after he saved you, he sent them off. | it's meant to be the most haunted building in britain. did i mention that? | do you want to move a bit closer? | to the shrieking shack? | hope you don't mean yourself. | harry! | he won't keep it. he'll turn it over to professor mcgonagall. aren't you? | look who it is. madam rosmerta. | ron fancies her. | harry! | so rude. | ron, look! | sorry. sorry. excuse me, excuse me. | harry, what happened? | beautiful day. | ronald has lost his rat. | rubbish. | well, maybe you should learn to take better care of your pets! | did not. | didn't. | how did it go, hagrid? the hearing? | and then? | do you mind me trying? | the grim, possibly. | i can't believe they're going to kill buckbeak. it's just too horrible. | you! you foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! | that felt good. | we'll stay with you too. | i think you owe someone an apology. | i meant me! | i thought i just saw...never mind. | ron. ron! | harry, you do realize what tree this is? | ron!! | ron! | duck! | harry! | oh, i'm sorry. | where do you suppose this goes? | we're in the shrieking shack, aren't we? | ron. you're okay. | if you want to kill harry, you have to kill us too! | no! i trusted you! | and all this time, you've been his friend. | he's a werewolf! | that's why he's been missing classes. | since professor snape set the essay. | you attacked a teacher! | you go, i'll stay. | that looks really painful. | i'm sure madam pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat. | harry! | harry! | wait. wait. | professor? professor lupin? | harry? | what? | listen harry, they've captured sirius. | any minute the dementors are gonna perform the kiss. | no. it's worse. | much worse. | they're going to suck out his soul. | headmaster, you've got to stop them. | they've got the wrong man. | the point is, we know the truth. | please believe us. | sorry, ron, but seeing as you can't walk... | 07:30. where were we at 7:30? | come on. and we can't be seen. | you! you foul, loathsome,evil little cockroach! | this is a time-turner, harry. | mcgonagall gave it to me first term. | this is how i've been getting to my lessons all year. | yes. | dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. | clearly, something happened he wants us to change. | thanks. | malfoy's coming. | that felt good. | of course. | remember what dumbledore said? | if we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. | let's go. | fudge has to see buckbeak before we steal him. | otherwise, he'll think hagrid set him free. | harry, you can't. | yes, and you must! | harry, you're in hagrid's hut now. | if you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. | awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time harry. | we can't be seen. | fudge is coming. | and we aren't leaving? | why aren't we leaving? | sorry. | we're coming out the back door. go! | is that really what my hair looks like from the back? | i thought i just saw… never mind. | okay, go, harry. go! | keep trying. come on. quickly. | come on. come on, buckbeak. | come and get the nice dead ferret. | come on. it's here. come on, beaky. | come on, buckbeak. come on. | buckbeak. | come on. | we save sirius. | no idea. | look. it's lupin. | and snape's coming. | and now we wait. | at least someone's enjoying himself. | yeah? | with a patronus. | i heard snape telling dumbledore. | according to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it. | harry, but your dad's... | here we come. | that's great. | harry! | saving your life. | yeah, i didn't think about that. run! | that was so scary. | this is horrible. | harry, listen to me. | no one's coming. | you're dying both of you. | harry! | no. but i don't like flying...! | bombarda! | we have to go. | what's he talking about, harry? | this came with it. | how fast is it, harry?"
neville;trevor! sorry. | that picture's moving. | the only problem is, i can't remember what i've forgotten. | down, down! | parvati patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom.  | she said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying. | how? i can barely stand at all! | no, that's all i need! | you to set my bloody kneecups on fire! | hey! wait! where are you going? | what about the countercurse? | neither should you.  | you're sneaking out again, arent you? | no! i won't let you! |  you'll get gryffindor in trouble again! |  i-i'll fight you. | go on, ron.  | i ignored one from my gran once.  | it was horrible. | please, get me down! | why is it always me? | harry, i don't know who did it, but you'd better come. | come on! | harry. it's hermione. | i think so. | i'm okay. okay. | yeah. | you don't think he'd come to hogwarts, do you? | professor snape. | professor snape. | yes. i don't want it to turn into her, either. | she carries a red handbag... | riddikulus! | hey. | harry. | wherever did you get it?
malfoy;"it's true then, what they're saying on the train. | harry potter has come to hogwarts. | this is crabbe, and goyle. | and i'm malfoy. | draco malfoy. | think my name's funny, do you? | i've no need to ask yours. | red hair and a hand-me-down robe? | you must be a weasley. | we'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, potter. | you don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. | i can help you there. | up. | did you see his face? | maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse. | no. i think i'll leave it somewhere for longbottom to find. | how about on the roof? | what's the matter, potter? | bit beyond your reach? | is that so? | have it your way, then. | excuse me, professor.  | perhaps i heard you wrong.  | i thought you said...""the four of us."" | the forest? i thought that was a joke!  | we can't go in there.  | students aren't allowed. |  and there are...werewolves! | okay. then i get fang! | you wait till my father hears about this.  | this is servant's stuff. | scared, potter?!  | did you hear that?  | come on, fang.  scared. | ahhhhhhhhh!!! ahhh! help!!!!! | nice one, mate! "
whispers;harry potter?
sorting hat;ah, right then... hmm... right. | okay. gryffindor! | slytherin! | let's see i know! hufflepuff! | another weasley! | i know just what to do with you. | gryffindor! | hmm... difficult, very difficult. | plenty of courage, i see. | not a bad mind, either. | there's talent, oh, yes. | and a thirst to prove yourself. | but where to put you? | not slytherin, eh? are you sure? | you could be great, you know. | it's all here, in your head. | and slytherin will help you on the way to greatnesses, no doubt about that. | no? well, if you're sure. | better be...gryffindor! | bee in your bonnet, potter? | yes. you were particularly difficult to place. | but i stand by what i said last year. | you would have done well in slytherin.
seamus;i'm half and half. | my dad's a muggle. mum's a witch. | bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out. | eye of rabbit, harp string hum | turn this water into rum. | eye of rabbit... | wingard levosa. wingardly lev...  | i'll do the countercurse! | i don't appreciate the insinuation, longbottom. | besides, if anyone cared to notice my eyebrows have completely grown back! | yeah! we won!! | no, ma'am, he's just fainted. | heads up, everyone.  | weasley's gotten himself a howler. | cornish pixies? | fortuna major. | here, listen. | she just won't let me in. | exactly. | hey, man. | ron, catch. | i think we have a winner. | oh, no. | the grin? what's the grin? | he's been sighted! | sirius black! | dementors? | he slipped past them once. | who's to say he won't do it again? | can i have a go, harry? | after you, of course.
percy;oh, thats professor snape, head of slytherin house. | potions. | but everyone knows, its the dark arts he fancies. | he's been after quirrell's job for years. | hello, sir nicholas. | have a nice summer? | gryffindors, follow me please. | keep up. thank you. | this is the most direct path to the dormitories. | oh, and keep an eye on the staircases. | they like to change. | keep up, please, and follow me. | quickly now, come on. come on. | caput draconis. | follow me, everyone. keep up. | quickly, come on. | gather around here. | welcome to the gryffindor common room. | boys' dormitory is upstairs and down to your left. | girls, the same on your right. | you'll find that your belongings have already been brought up. | gryffindors...keep up please.  | and stay alert! | errol... | oh look, it’s our hogwarts letters.  | and they’ve sent us harry’s as well. | hello, sir nicolas. | excuse me. | i happen to be a school prefect. | you, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night. | what are your names again? | mind your attitude, malfoy. | let me through, please. | excuse me! i'm head boy! | get back, all of you. | no one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched. | keep calm, everyone. break into fours. | back to your common room. | be quiet. make way. | the headmaster's here. | you heard. move! | mind where you're going! slow down! | you listen! i'm head boy! | come back here!
sir nicholas;hello! how are you? | welcome to gryffindor. | dismal. once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. | i prefer sir nicholas, if you don't mind. | like this. | have you heard?  | harry potter's the new gryffindor seeker.  | i always knew hed do well. | hello, percy, miss clearwater. | thank you. | good evening. | thank you. | hello. | hermione! welcome back.
girl;look, it's the bloody baron! | oh, look! look! | who's that girl? | is he all right? | hufflepuff, this way!
man in paint;welcome to hogwarts.
fat lady;password? | no, no. wait, wait. | watch this. | amazing. just with my voice. | yes, all right. go in. | eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name. | it's him, headmaster. | the one they all talk about. | he's here, somewhere in the castle! | sirius black!
snape;"there will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. | as such, i don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. | however, for those select few who possess the predisposition i can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. | i can tell you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper in death. | then again, maybe some of you have come to hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention. | mr. potter. | our new celebrity. | tell me, what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? | you don't know? well, let's try again. | where, mr potter, would you look if i asked you to find me a bezoar? | and what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane? | pity. | clearly, fame isn't everything is it, mr. potter? | silence. | put your hand down, you silly girl! | for your information, potter | asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of the living dead. | a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. | as for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. | well... | why aren't you all copying this down? | and gryffindors note that five points will be taken from your house for your classmate's cheek. | good luck today, potter.  | then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against slytherin. | what? oh! | you don't want me as your enemy, quirrell. | you know perfectly well what i mean.  | we'll have another chat soon... | when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie. |  good afternoon.  | now, what would three young gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this? | you want to be careful. | people will think you're up to something. | you were seen by no less than seven muggles. | do you have any idea how serious this is? | you have risked the exposure of our world. | not to mention the damage you inflicted on a whomping willow. | that's been on these grounds since before you were born. | silence. | i assure you that were you in slytherin, and your fate rested with me...  | the both of you would be on the train home tonight. | as it is... | headmaster these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry. | if i might, headmaster? | perhaps potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. | however the circumstances are suspicious. | i, for one, don't recall seeing potter at dinner. | yes, miss granger? | expelliarmus! | perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, professor. | weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. | we'll be sending potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. | might i suggest someone from my own house? | malfoy, perhaps? | don't move, potter. | i'll get rid of it for you. | vipera evanesca. | a girl has been snatched by the monster, lockhart.  | your moment has come at last. | weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the chamber of secrets is? | i've done the dungeons. | no sign of black, nor anywhere else in the castle. | remarkable feat, don't you think? | to enter hogwarts castle on one's own completely undetected? | any theories on how he managed it? | you may recall prior to the start of term i expressed concerns about your appointment of professor... | what about potter? | should he be warned? | turn to page 394. | that's not really your concern, is it, potter? | suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time. | turn to page 394. | quiet. | now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an animagus and a werewolf? | no one? | how disappointing. | thank you, mr. malfoy. | that's the second time you've spoken out of turn, miss granger. | are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all? | five points from gryffindor. | as an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis on recognizing it. | then i suggest you take extra care, mr. potter. | loss of limb will not excuse you. | page 394. | the term ""werewolf"" is a contraction of the anglo-saxon word ""were"" which means ""man,"" and ""wolf."" werewolf, man-wolf. | there are several ways to become a werewolf. | they include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf... | potter. | what are you doing wandering the corridors at night? | how extraordinarily like your father you are, potter. | he, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle. | turn out your pockets. | turn out your pockets! | what's this? | really? open it. | reveal your secrets. | read it. | go on. | you insolent little... | well, well. lupin. | out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we? | that remains to be seen. | i have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact. | take a look, lupin. | supposed to be your area of expertise. | clearly, it's full of dark magic. | expelliarmus! | vengeance is sweet. | how i hoped i'd be the one to catch you. | i told dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. here's the proof. | give me a reason. i beg you! | you two, quarrelling like an old married couple. | i could do it, you know. | but why deny the dementors? | they're so longing to see you. | do i detect a flicker of fear? | oh, yes. a dementor's kiss. one can only imagine what that must be like. | it's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but i'll do my best. | after you. | there you are, potter! | come back here, potter!"
dean;hey, look! neville's got a remembrall | ron, is that your owl? | oh, god. | you call that a monkey? | that's a boggart, that is.
madam hooch;"good afternoon, class. | good afternoon, amanda. | good afternoon. | welcome to your first flying lesson. | well, what are you waiting for?  | everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. | come on now, hurry up.  | stick your right hand over the broom and say, ""up."" | with feeling. | now, once you've got hold of your broom, i want you to mount it. | and grip it tight, you don't wanna be sliding off the end. | when i blow my whistle, i want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. | keep your broom steady, hover for a moment | then lean forward slightly and touch back down. | on my whistle. three, two... | mr. longbottom. | mr. longbottom! | come back down this instant! | everyone out of the way! | oh, dear, it's a broken wrist. | poor boy. come on now, up you get. | everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while i take mr longbottom to the hospital wing. | understand? if i see a single broom in the air the one riding it will find themselves out of hogwarts before they can say, quidditch. | now, i want a nice clean game...from all of you.  | gryffindor win!"
class;good afternoon, madam hooch. | up! | neville! | the swish and flick.  | good morning, everyone. | riddikulus! | riddikulus!
filch;anyone here, my sweet? come on. | who's there?!  | i know you're in there.  | you can't hide.  | who is it?  | show yourself! | oh, professors. i found this, in the restricted section.  | it's still hot.  | that means there's a student out of bed. | a pity they let the old punishments die.  | there was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.  | god, i miss the screaming.  | you'll be serving detention with hagrid tonight. | he's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. | a sorry lot this, hagrid.  | oh, good god, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you? | oh, for gods sake, pull yourself together, man.  | you're going into the forest, after all.  | got to have your wits about you. |  there's more than werewolves in those trees, lad.  | you can be sure of that. | nighty-night. | well, take a good look, lads. | this night might well be the last you spend in this castle. | oh, dear, we are in trouble. | as such... | what's going on here? | go on. make way, make way. | potter? | what are you...? | mrs. norris? | you've murdered my cat. | i'll kill you. | i'll kill you! | ask him. | it's him that's done it. | you saw what he wrote on the wall. | rubbish. | my cat has been petrified. | i want to see some punishment! | caught in the act. | i'll have you out this time, potter. | mark my words. | those with permission, follow me. | those without, stay put. | come on, move. | there's no need for ghosts, professor. | the fat lady's there. | i've searched the astronomy tower and the owlery.  | there's nothing there.
all;ahhhhhhh!  | yay!
oliver;quidditch is easy enough to understand.  | each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you.  | there are three kinds of balls.  | this one's called the quaffle. | now, the chasers handle the quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops.  | the keeper, that's me, defends the hoops.  | with me so far? | you better take this.  | careful now, it's comin' back.  | eh, not bad, potter, you'd make a fair beater...uh-oh.  | bludger. nasty little buggers.  | but you are a seeker. | the only ball i want you to worry about is this...the golden snitch.  | ah, you like it now.  | just wait.  | it's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see. | you catch it...before the other team's seeker.  | you catch this, the game is over.  | you catch this, potter, and we win. | that's all right.  | i felt the same way before my first game. | er, i don't really remember.  | i took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in.  | woke up in the hospital a week later.
flitwick;one of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly.  | uh, do you all have your feathers? good.  | now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm?  | the swish and flick. everyone.  | good.  | and enunciate.  | wingardium leviosa.  | off you go then. | oh, well done!  | see here, everyone!  | ms. granger's done it!  | oh, splendid! | whooaaa! ooh.
draco;wingardium levio-saaa. | no! | can i have this? |  it's not my fault the teachers have favorites.  | that hermione granger -- | i'll bet you loved that, didn't you, potter? | famous harry potter. | can't go into a bookshop without making the front page. | look, potter. | you've got yourself a girlfriend. | see you at school. | that's right. | and that's not all that's new this year. | you see, weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best. | no one asked your opinion, you filthy little mudblood. | enemies of the heir, beware. | you'll be next, mudbloods. | all right there, scarhead? | training for the ballet, potter!! | you'll never catch me, potter. | scared, potter? | everte statum! | serpensortia! | crabbe, goyle, where have you been? | pigging out in the great hall all this time? | why are you wearing glasses? | reading? | i didn't know you could read. | and what are you doing down here, weasley? | well, sit down. | you'd never know the weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. | they're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. all of them. | what's wrong with you, crabbe? | i'm surprised the daily prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. | i suppose dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. | father always said dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place. | what? | you think there's someone here who's worse than dumbledore? | well? do you? | good one, goyle. | you're absolutely right. | saint potter. | and people actually think that he's the heir of slytherin? | you know i don't, goyle. | i told you yesterday. | how many times do i have to tell you? | is this yours? | but my father did say this: | it's been 50 years since the chamber was opened. | he wouldn't tell me who opened it. | only that they were expelled. | the last time the chamber of secrets was opened, a mudblood died. | so it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. | as for me i hope it's granger. | what's the matter with you two? | you're acting very odd. | hey! where are you going? | potter. is it true you fainted? | i mean, you actually fainted? | exactly how do we do that? | don't be such a wimp, longbottom. | oh, yeah. terribly funny. | witty. god, this place has gone to the dogs. | wait until father hears dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes. | dementor! dementor! | oh, please. | you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute! | it's killed me! | you're gonna regret this. | you and your bloody chicken! | it comes and it goes. | still, i consider myself lucky. | madam pomfrey said another minute and i could've lost my arm. | i can't do homework for weeks. | this class is ridiculous. | well, well. look who's here. | you two shopping for your new dream home? | bit grand for you, isn't it, weasle-bee? | don't your family sleep in one room? | not very friendly. | boys, i think it's time we teach weasle-bee how to respect his superiors. | how dare you talk to me! | you filthy little mudblood! | who is that? | don't stand there! do something! | get out of the way! | move! | what did i say? father said i can keep the hippogriff's head. | i'll donate it to the gryffindors' room. | this is going to be rich. | come to see the show? | not a word to anyone, understood? | come to see the show? | not a word to anyone, understood? | i'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! mark my words.
ron and harry;well, what it is... | the what? |   hermione!!
oiiver;scared, harry?

hermoine;and what, may i ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam? | no, you won't. | besides, according to professor mcgonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti cheating spell.
all 3;we know about the sorcerer's stone!
firenze;harry potter, you must leave.  | you are known to many creatures here.  | the forest is not safe at this time.  | especially for you. | a monstrous creature.  | it is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.  | drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death.  | but at a terrible price.  | you have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life.  | a cursed life. | can you think of no one? | do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment? | harry potter, this is where i leave you.  | you're safe now. good luck.
voldemort;use the boy | he lies. | let me speak to him. | i have strength enough for this.  | harry potter. we meet again. | yes. you see what i have become?  | see what i must do to survive?  | live off another. a mere parasite.  | unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own.  | but there is something that can.  | something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket! | stop him!  | don't be a fool!  | why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?! | haha. bravery. your parents had it too.  | tell me, harry, would you like to see your mother and father again?  | together, we can bring them back.  | all i ask for is something in return.  | that's it, harry.  | there is no good and evil.  | there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.  | together, we'll do extraordinary things.  | just give me the stone!  | kill him! | fool! get the stone! | arrrhhhhhh!
students;whoo! yeah!
uncle vernon;i’m warning you, if you can’t control that bloody bird it’ll have to go. | i should think you’d be a little more grateful.  | we’ve raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have dudley’s second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts. | which should be any minute!  | ahem...now let’s go over our schedule once again, shall we?  | petunia when the masons arrive you will be...? | good! and- and dudley, you will be...? | excellent! ...and you...? | too right, you will.  | with any luck, this could well be the day i make the biggest deal of my career.  | and you will not mess it up! | mr. and mrs. mason! do come in! | ohh, don’t mind that!  | it’s just the cat. | what the devil are you doing up here? | you just ruined the punch line of my japanese golfer joke! | one more sound, and you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy!  | and fix that door! | ...it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep.  | and one plumber said “look at all that water.”  | a-and the second plumber said, “yes, and that’s just the top of it!” | i’m so sorry! it’s my nephew- he’s very disturbed.  | meeting strangers upsets him.  | that’s why i kept him upstairs! | you’re never going back to that school.  | you’re never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. never! | now, what the hell’s he doing? potter! | petunia, he’s escaping! | come here! | oh no, boy! you and that bloody pigeon aren’t going anywhere! | no! no! no! no! aaaah! | oh... damn. | what is it? | later perhaps. if you behave. | take marge's suitcase upstairs. | can i tempt you, marge? | st. brutus'. it's a fine institution for hopeless cases. | i think it's time you went to bed. | stop! | i've got you, marge. i've got you. | hold on, hold on. | get off. | sorry. | oh, god. marge! | please! marge! come back! | you bring her back! | you bring her back now. | you put her right! | you can't do magic outside school. | they won't let you back now. | you've nowhere to go.

mr. weasley;morning, weasleys. | what a night. nine raids. nine! | well now. aah! and who are you? | good lord! are you really?  | well, ron’s told us all about you, of course. | when did he get here? | did you really? how’d it go? did you— | i mean...that was very wrong, indeed, boys.  | very wrong of you | now, harry, you must know all about muggles.  | tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck? | dumbledore must know you’re here, harry.  | doesn’t miss a trick, that man. | diagonally. | children, it's mad in here. | let's go outside. | lucius. | we have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, malfoy. | 10:58, come on. | fred, george, percy, you first. | after you, dear. | harry potter. | harry, wonder if i might have a word? | hermione. | looking forward to a new term? | harry, some within the ministry would strongly discourage me from divulging what i'm about to reveal to you. | but i think that you need to know the facts. | you are in danger. | grave danger. | what do you know about sirius black, harry? | do you know why? | thirteen years ago, when you stopped... | don't say his name. | when you stopped you-know-who black lost everything. | but to this day, he still remains a faithful servant. | and in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of you-know-who returning to power. | and that is why he has escaped from azkaban. | to find you. | harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for black.
fred, george, ron;morning, dad.
fred, george, ron, harry;oh, it...
mr. borgin;mr. malfoy! what a pleasure to see you again.  | if i may, just in today -- |  selling? | hmmm... yes. i see... | ah, the hand of glory.  | insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder.  | best friend of thieves and plunderers.  | your son has fine taste, sir. | it's the same all over.  | wizard blood is counting for less everywhere.
lucius malfoy;i'm not buying today, mr. borgin. | but selling. | you have heard, of course, that the ministry of magic is conducting more raids.  | there are even rumors of a new muggle protection act... | i have a few... ah... items at home that might prove embarrassing if the ministry were to call. | certain poisons and the like... |  hopefully my son will amount to more than a thief, mr. borgin. | though if his marks don't pick up -- | i would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizarding family beat you in every exam. | not with me. | very good.  | i'll expect you at the manor tomorrow.  | come, draco. | now, now, draco, play nicely. | mr. potter. | lucius malfoy. we meet at last. | forgive me. | your scar is legend. | as, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you. | you must be very brave to mention his name. | or very foolish. | and you must be miss granger. | yes, draco has told me all about you.  | and your parents. | muggles, aren't they? | let me see. | red hair, vacant expressions tatty, secondhand book. | you must be the weasleys. | well, well, well. weasley senior. | busy time at the ministry, arthur, all those extra raids? | i do hope they're paying you overtime but judging by the state of this, i'd say not. | what's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it? | clearly. | associating with muggles. | and i thought your family could sink no lower. | i'll see you at work. | already here, fudge? | good. | believe me i take absolutely no pleasure being inside your... | you call this a house? | no. | i simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here. | the other governors and i have decided it's time for you to step aside. | this is an order of suspension. | you'll find all 12 signatures on it. | i'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. | well, what, with all these attacks there'll be no muggle-borns left at hogwarts. | i can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school. | you think so? | admirable sentiments. | shall we? | fudge. | i'll deal with you later. | out of my way, potter. | so it's true. you have returned. | ridiculous. | how dare you! | my sole concern has always been and will always be the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. | the culprit has been identified, i presume? | and? | who was it? | i see. | well, let us hope that mr. potter will always be around to save the day. | dumbledore. | come, dobby. we're leaving. | mine? i don't know what you're talking about. | you do, do you? | why don't you prove it? | come, dobby. | dobby. | what? i didn't give... | you lost me my servant! | your parents were meddlesome fools too. | mark my words, potter. | one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end.

professor sprout;morning, everyone. | good morning, professor sprout. | welcome to greenhouse three, second years.  | today, we will be re-potting mandrakes.  | now, who here can tell me the properties of the mandrake?  | yes, miss granger. | excellent. ten points to gryffindor. | as our mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet. | but they could knock you out for hours, which is why i have given you earmuffs for auditory protection. | so could you please put them on, right away? quickly. | flaps tight down, and watch me closely. | you grasp your mandrake firmly. | you pull it sharply up out of the pot. | got it? and now you dunk it down into the other pot | and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm. | longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs. | yes, well, just leave him there. | right, on we go. | plenty of pots to go around. | grasp your mandrake and pull it up.
penelope clearwater;there's nearly headless nick.

gilderoy lockhart;let me introduce you to your new defense against the dark arts teacher.  | me. gilderoy lockhart, order of merlin, third class, honorary member of the dark force defense league and five times winner of witch weekly's most-charming-smile award   | but i don't talk about that.  | i didn't get rid of the bandon banshee by smiling at her! | now, be warned. | it is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. | you may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. | know only that no harm can befall you whilst i am here. | i must ask you not to scream. | it might provoke them. | freshly caught cornish pixies. | laugh if you will, mr. finnegan but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters. | let's see what you make of them. | come on now, round them up, round them up! | they're only pixies. | peskipiksi pesternomi! | i'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage. | harry, harry, harry. | can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me to answer my fan mail? | fame is a fickle friend, harry. | celebrity is as celebrity does. | remember that. | sorry? | voice? | what are you talking about, harry? | i think you're getting a bit drowsy. | and great scott, no wonder.  | look at the time. | we've been here nearly four hours. | spooky how the time flies when one is having fun. | aghh! thought so. | so unlucky i wasn't there. | i know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her. | i'm afraid that's my doing, severus. | you see, harry was helping me answer my fan mail. | not to worry, harry.  | i will fix that arm of yours straight away. | boy doesn't know what he's saying. | this won't hurt a bit. | brackium emendo! | yes, well, that can sometimes happen but the point is you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken. | much more flexible, though. | gather round! | gather round. | can everybody see me? | can you all hear me? | excellent. | in light of the dark events of recent weeks professor dumbledore has granted me permission to start this dueling club to train you all up. | in case you ever need to defend yourselves as i myself have done on countless occasions. | for full details, see my published works. | let me introduce my assistant professor snape. | he has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration. | i don't want any of you youngsters to worry. | you'll still have your potions master when i'm through with him. never fear. | one.two. three! | an excellent idea to show them that, professor snape... | but if you don't mind me saying, it was obvious what you were about to do. | if i had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy. | an excellent suggestion, professor snape.. | let's have a volunteer pair.  | potter, weasley, how about you? | good luck, potter. | wands at the ready. | on the count of three cast your charms to disarm your opponent. only to disarm. | we don't want any accidents here. | one. two... | i said disarm only. | allow me, professor snape. | alarte ascendare! | so sorry. dozed off. | what have i missed? | my moment? | very well. | i'll just be in my office getting... | getting ready. | well, yes. urgent call. unavoidable. | got to go. | well… aemm… | as to that, most unfortunate. | no one regrets more than i. | i must say, when i took the job, there was nothing in the description... | books can be misleading. | my dear boy, use your common sense. | my books wouldn't have sold as well if people didn't think i'd done those things. | yes, now you mention it. | i'm rather gifted with memory charms. | otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. | i'd never have sold another book. | in fact, i'm going to have to do the same to you. | excellent, harry. good work. | well, then, i'll just be... | there's no need for me to stay. | now, boys, what good will it do? | but... obviously, yes. | sure you don't want to test it first? | it's really quite filthy down here. | it looks like a snake. | the adventure ends here, boys. | but don't fret. | the world will know our story. | how i was too late to save the girl. | how you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. | so...you first, mr. potter. | say goodbye to your memories. | obliviate! | hello. who are you? | really? | and who am i? | it's an odd sort of place, isn't it? | do you live here? | really? | amazing! | this is just like magic!
cornish pixies;you just stay there!
wood;i spent the summer devising a whole new quidditch program. | we're gonna train earlier, harder and longer. | what...? i don't believe it. | where you think you're going, flint? | i booked the pitch for gryffindor today. | i, professor severus snape, do hereby give the slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new seeker. | you've got a new seeker. who? | watch yourself, harry! | all right, listen up. | we play our game, hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. | we're stronger, quicker and smarter. | well, that too. | professor mcgonagall. | we can't cancel quidditch.
voice;come. | come to me. | blood. | i smell blood. | let me rip you. | let me kill you. | kill! | kill! | kill! | it's time. | kill. kill.!! | time to kill.. | i want blood. | they all must die. | kill. kill. kill. | time to kill. | put that light out! | watch it there, boy. | we're trying to sleep here! | are you deaf? put that light out! | harry potter
picture;she's right, you know.
slytherins;yeah! yeah!
madam pomfrey;mr. malfoy, stop making such a fuss. | you can go. out of my way. | should have been brought straight to me. | i can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back... | i'll be able to, certainly. | but it'll be painful. | you're in for a rough night, potter. | regrowing bones is a nasty business. | what do you expect? | pumpkin juice? | put him here. | what happened? | who is it that the monster's taken, minerva?
moaning myrtle;i'm moaning myrtle. | i wouldn't expect you to know me. | who would ever talk about ugly, miserable moping moaning myrtle? aaaaaa… | wait till you see. it's awful. | ohh-uhh..come to throw something else at me? | don't ask me. here i am, minding my own business and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me. | sure! let's all throw books at myrtle because she can't feel it. | ten points if you get it through her stomach! | fifty points if it goes through her head! | i don't know. i didn't see them. | i was just sitting in the u-bend, thinking about death and it fell through the top of my head. | whoo-oooh-whoooo... | who's there? | hello, harry. | what do you want? | it was dreadful. | it happened right here in this very cubicle. | i'd hidden because olive hornby was teasing me about my glasses. | i was crying, and then i heard somebody come in. | i don't know. i was distraught! | but they said something funny, a kind of made-up language. | and i realized it was a boy, so i unlocked the door to tell him to go away and i died. | i just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes over there by that sink. | oh, harry? | if you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.
justin finch-fletchley;what are you playing at?
crabbe;cool. umm..um. | what? | malfoy! wait! wait!
diary;hello harry potter, my name is tom riddle. | yes. | no. but i can show you. | let me take you back fifty years ago. | 13th june..
tom riddle;professor dumbledore. | yes, professor. i suppose i... | i had to see for myself if the rumors were true. | about the school as well? | i don't have a home to go to. | they wouldn't really close hogwarts, would they, professor? | sir, if it all stopped, if the person responsible was caught... | no, sir. nothing. | good night, sir. | evening, hagrid. | i'm going to have to turn you in hagrid | i don't think you meant it to kill anyone... | the dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow.  | the least hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered. | monsters don't make good pets, hagrid. | now, stand aside. | stand aside, hagrid. | cistem aperio! | arania exumai! | i can't let you go. | they'll have your wand for this, hagrid. | you'll be expelled. | she won't wake. | she's still alive, but only just. | a memory preserved in a diary for 50 years. | it won't come until it's called. | you won't be needing it. | i'm afraid i can't do that. | you see, as poor ginny grows weaker, i grow stronger. | yes, harry, it was ginny weasley who opened the chamber of secrets. | it was ginny who set the basilisk on the mudbloods and filch's cat ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls. | because i told her to. | you'll find i can be very persuasive. | not that she knew what she was doing. | she was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. | still, the power of the diary began to scare her. | she tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. | and then who should find it but you? | the very person i was most anxious to meet. | i knew i had to talk to you, meet you if i could. | so i decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf hagrid to gain your trust. | it was my word against hagrid's. | only dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent. | he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. |  i knew it wouldn't be safe to open the chamber again while i was at school so i decided to leave behind a diary preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages so that one day | i would be able to lead another to finish salazar slytherin's noble work. | haven't i told you? killing mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. | for many months now, my new target has been you. | how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? | how did you escape with nothing but a scar while lord voldemort's powers were destroyed? | voldemort is my past, present and future. | surely you didn't think .i was going to keep my filthy muggle father's name? | no. i fashioned myself a new name, a name i knew wizards everywhere would fear to speak when i became the greatest sorcerer in the world. | dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me. | so this is what dumbledore sends his great defender. | a songbird and an old hat. | let's match the power of lord voldemort, heir of salazar slytherin against the famous harry potter. | parseltongue won't save you now, potter.  | it only obeys me. | no! your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you. | yes, potter. | the process is nearly complete. | in a few minutes, ginny weasley will be dead, and i will cease to be a memory. | lord voldemort will return .very much alive. | remarkable, isn't it? how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? | i'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. | you'll be with your dear mudblood mother soon, harry. | funny, the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly little girl. | what are you doing? | stop. no!
harry-ron-hermione;no.
fudge;"bad business, hagrid, very bad business. | had to come. | three attacks on muggle-borns. | things have gone far enough. | the ministry's got to act. | albus, look, hagrid's record is against him. | i've got to take him. | i'm afraid we have no choice, hagrid. | come, hagrid. | good boy. | as minister for magic, it is my duty to inform you, mr. potter earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of sheffield, circling a chimney stack. | the accidental magic reversal department was dispatched immediately. | she has been properly punctured and her memory modified. | she will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. | so that's that and no harm done. | pea soup? | yes? | understand? | come now harry. the ministry doesn't send people to azkaban for blowing up their aunts. | on the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible. | we have a killer on the loose. | nothing, of course. you're safe. | and that's what matters. | and tomorrow you'll be on your way back to hogwarts. | these are your new schoolbooks. | i took the liberty of having them brought here. | now tom will show you to your room. | oh, by the way, harry. whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander. | professor mcgonagall! | oh, hagrid... | rosmerta, my dear. | i hope business is good. | we have...we have a killer on the loose. | harry potter. | shh! come. | not only did black lead him to the potters that night he also killed one of their friends peter pettigrew! | black was vicious. | he didn't kill pettigrew. he destroyed him! | a finger. that's all that was left. | a finger. nothing else. | and now he wants to finish what he started. | that's not the worst of it. | black was vicious. | he didn 't kill pettigrew, he destroyed him! | on the slope. | no, hagrid. | well, i think we should get down to our business, shall we? | very well. it is the decision of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures that the hippogriff buckbeak here in after called ""the condemned,"" shall be executed this day at sundown. | the execution shall dispatch... | yes, very well. perhaps it would be... | your name only. | where? | what am i supposed to see? | oh, yes. indeed, indeed. | i see no strawberries. | where? | let's get this over, please. | but where is it? | i saw the beast, just now. | not a moment ago! | come now, dumbledore. | someone's obviously released him. | hagrid? | well, well. | we must search the grounds."
aragog;who is it? | hagrid? | is that you? | yes. | hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before. | that's a lie. | hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets. | no. | the monster was born in the castle. | i came to hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler. | we do not speak of it. | it is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. | i never saw any part of the castle but the box in which hagrid kept me. | the girl was discovered in a bathroom. | when i was accused, hagrid brought me here. | go? | i think not. | my sons and daughters do not harm hagrid on my command. | but i cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. | goodbye, friend of hagrid.

| i thought it'd be obvious. | i assumed it would take the shape of lord voldemort. | i'm very impressed. | that suggests what you fear the most is fear itself. | this is very wise. | dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. | our pain becomes their power. | the very first time i saw you, harry, i recognized you immediately. | not by your scar, by your eyes. | they're your mother, lily's. | yes. oh, yes. i knew her. | your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. | not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman. | she had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. | and your father, james, on the other hand he... | he had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. | a talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. | you're more like them than you know, harry. | in time, you'll come to see just how much. | i'm sorry to hear about your broomstick. | is there no chance of fixing it? | listen. | dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth. | they feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. | you are not weak, harry. | dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past. | horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. | you have nothing to be ashamed of. | well, i'd consider you a fool if you weren't. | there was only one that night. | i don't pretend to be an expert, harry. | but as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps i should teach you. | but after the holidays. | for now, i need to rest. | harry. there you are. you came. | are you sure about this, harry? | this is very advanced magic well beyond the ordinary wizarding level. | well, everything's prepared. | the spell i'm going to try yo teach you is called the patronus charm. | did you ever hear of it? | no? well...a patronus is a positive force. | for the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. | but in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory. | not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory. | can you do this? | very well. close your eyes. | concentrate. | explore your past. | do you have a memory? | allow it to fill you up. | lose yourself within it. | then speak the incantation, expecto patronum. | very good. | here we go. come on. | sit up. deep breaths. | it's all right. i didn't expect you to do it the first time. | that would have been remarkable. | here, eat this. you'll feel better. | oh, no, no, no. | that was a boggart, harry. a boggart. | the real thing would be worse. | much, much worse. | as a matter of interest, what were you thinking? | which memory did you choose? | that's not good enough. | not nearly good enough. | is it strong? | then let's give it a try. you feel ready? | yes! well done, harry. well done! | yes. sit down. here. | eat this, it helps. it really helps. | and just so you know, harry i think you'd have given your father a run for his money. | and that is saying something. | professor! | harry, are you all right? | i seriously doubt it, severus. | it looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it. | i suspect it's a zonko product. | nevertheless, i shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. | it is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. | harry, would you come with me, please? professor, good night. | come in. | i haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, i am astounded that you didn't hand it in. | did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of sirius black is a map to you? | no. | your father never set much store by the rules either. | but he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. | gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them! | now, i will not cover up for you again. | do you hear me? | i want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. | and don't take any detours. | if you do, i shall know. | oh, really? and who might that be? | that's not possible. | expelliarmus! | well, well, sirius. | looking rather ragged, aren't we? | finally, the flesh reflects the madness within. | i know. | i understand. | how long have you known? | well, hermione. | you are the brightest witch of your age i've ever met. | wait! | very well. kill him. | but wait one more minute. | harry has the right to know why. | no, it wasn't him. | somebody did betray your parents somebody who, until quite recently, i believed to be dead! | severus... | severus don't be a fool. | sirius be quiet. | severus, please. | he was at school with us. | we thought he was our friend! | no, he didn't. | i thought so too, until you mentioned pettigrew on the map! | you sold james and lily to voldemort! | harry, this man... | get away from her! | immobulus! | hello, harry. | i saw you coming. | i've looked worse, believe me. | no. no. i resigned, actually. | well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. | this time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children. | dumbledore has already risked enough on my behalf. | besides, people like me are... | well, let's just say that i'm used to it by now. | why do you look so miserable, harry? | didn't make any difference? | harry, it made all the difference in the world. | you uncovered the truth. | you saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. | it made a great deal of difference. | if i am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year. | now, since i am no longer your teacher i feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. | so now i'll say goodbye, harry. | i feel sure we'll meet again sometime. | until then mischief managed.
trelawney;welcome, my children. | in this room, you shall explore the noble art of divination. | in this room, you shall discover if you possess the sight. | hello. i am professor trelawney. | together we shall cast ourselves into the future. | this term, we'll focus on tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves. | so please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you. | what do you see? | the truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read. | but first, you must broaden your minds. | first, you must look beyond. | you, boy... | is your grandmother quite well? | i wouldn't be so sure of that. | give me the cup. | pity. | broaden your minds. | your aura is pulsing, dear. | are you in the beyond? | i think you are. | look at the cup. | tell me what you see. | give me the cup. | oh, my dear boy. | my dear you have the grim. | broaden your minds. | you must look beyond. | the art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the inner eye. | only then can you see. try again. | now, what do we have here? | my dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class i sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of divination. | no, you see, there. | you may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave. | have i said something? | he will return tonight. | tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free. | innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more. | i'm so sorry, dear boy. | did you say something?
bem;"not the grin, you idiot. the grim. | taking form of a giant spectral dog. | it's among the darkest omens in our world. | it's an omen of death."" | does he get to fly? | that's right. black could be anywhere. | it's like trying to catch smoke. | like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands."

madam rosmerta;it'd be a lot better if the ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night! | sirius black in hogsmeade! | and what would bring him here? | harry potter? | nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits. | tell me what this is all about. | peter pettigrew? | i remember. | never let james and sirius out of his sight. | what happened? | i don't believe it. | what could be worse? | peter pettigrew?
shrunken head 1;no underage wizards allowed in today! | thick heads?! | young whippersnappers!
shrunken head 2;shut the damn door! | how dare they! | who are they calling thick heads?
goyle;look who's here. | malfoy, are you okay? | let's go. quick. | run.
sirius;no. only one will die tonight. | are you going to kill me, harry? | well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you remus? | i found him. | it's him. | let's kill him! | enough talk, remus! | come on, let's kill him! | i did my waiting! | twelve years of it! in azkaban! | peter pettigrew! | and he's in this room! right now! | come out, come out, peter! | come out, come out and play! | brilliant, snape. | once again you've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion. | if you'll excuse us, remus and i have business to attend to. | he can't help it. it's habit. | be quiet yourself! | why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set! | the map never lies! | pettigrew's alive! | and he's right there! | not you! your rat! | twelve years? | curiously long life for a common garden rat! | he's missing a toe, isn't he? | finger! | dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead! | and then he transformed into a rat! | how dare you speak to harry! | how dare you talk about james in front of him! | i'm gonna died, i'm gonna die rather than betray my friends! | should have realized if voldemort didn't kill you, we would. together! | sorry about the bite. | i reckon that twinges a bit. | i was going for the rat. | normally, i have a very sweet disposition as a dog. | more than once, james suggested that i make the change permanent. | the tail i could live with. | but the fleas, they're murder. | it's beautiful, isn't it? | i'll never forget the first time i walked through those doors. | it'll be nice to do it again as a free man. | that was a noble thing you did back there. | he doesn't deserve it. | i don't know if you know, harry but when you were born, james and lily made me your godfather. | i can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home... | it's just a thought. | i can understand if you don't want to. | remus, my old friend. | have you taken your potion tonight? | you know the man you truly are, remus! | this heart is where you truly live! here! | this flesh is only flesh! | remus! remus! | run! run! | run! run! | i'll be forever grateful for this to both of you. | one day, perhaps. | for some time, my life will be too unpredictable. | and besides you're meant to be here. | and you know it. | and for now, that will do. | i expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father. | except your eyes. you have... | it's cruel that i spent so much time with james and lily, and you so little. | but know this: the ones that love us never really leave us. | and you can always find them in here. | you really are the brightest witch of your age.
pettigrew;remus? sirius. my old friends! | harry! look at you. | you look so much like your father. | james. we were the best of friends... | i didn't mean to! | the dark lord. you have no idea the weapons he possesses! | ask yourself, sirius! | what would you have done? | what would you have done? | james wouldn't have wanted me killed! | your dad would have spared me! | he would have shown me mercy! | bless you, boy. bless you! | turn me into a flobberworm. | anything but the dementors! | ron! haven't i been a good pet? | you won't let them give me to the dementors, will you? | i was your rat! | sweet, clever girl! surely you won't...
boy 1;go on, harry!
