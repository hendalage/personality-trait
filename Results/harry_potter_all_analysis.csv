dumbledore,i shouldve known that you would be here professor mcgonagall im afraid so professor the good and the bad hagrid is bringing him ah professor i would trust hagrid with my life no problems i trust hagrid albus do you really think its safe leaving him with these people the only family he has exactly hes far better off growing up away from all of that until hes ready there there hagrid its not really goodbye after all good luckharry potter i have a few startofterm notices i wish to announce the first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students also our caretaker mr filch has asked me to remind you that the thirdfloor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death thank you let the feast begin sillllleeennnnceeeee  everyone will please not panic  now prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories  teachers will follow me to the dungeons back again harry i see that you like so many before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised  i trust by now you realize what it does  let me give you a clue  the happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself exactly as he is yesand no  it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desires of our hearts  now you who have never known your family you see them standing beside you  but remember this harry  this mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth  men have wasted away in front of it even gone mad  that is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home and i must ask you not to go looking for it again it does not do to dwell on dreams harry and forget to live good afternoon harry  ah tokens from your admirers what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows  ah i see your friend ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your chocolate frogs fine theyre both just fine relax dear boy the stone has been destroyed  my friend nicholas and i had a little chat and agreed it was best all around he has enough elixir to set his affairs in order  but yes he will die ah you see only a person who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it  that is one of my more brilliant ideas  and between you and me thats saying something ah im afraid there are ways in which he can return  harry do you know why professor quirrell couldnt bear to have you touch him it was because of your mother  she sacrificed herself for you and that kind of act leaves a mark  no no this kind of mark cannot be seen it lives in your very skin love harry love  ah bertie botts every flavour beans  i was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one and since then i have lost my liking for them  but i think i could be safe with a nice toffee mm alas earwax another year gone  and now as i understand it the house cup needs awarding and the points stand thus  in fourth place gryffindor with 312 points  third place hufflepuff with 352 points  in second place ravenclaw with 426 points and in first place with 472 points slytherin house yes yes well done slytherin well done slytherin  however recent events must be taken into account  and i have a few last minute points to award  to miss hermione granger for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril 50 points  second to mr ronald weasley for the best played game of chess that hogwarts has seen these many years50 points  and third to mr harry potter for pure nerve and outstanding courage i award gryffindor house 60 points  and finally it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies but a great deal more to stand up to your friends  i award 10 points to neville longbottom assuming that my calculations are correct i believe that a change of direction is in order  gryffindor wins the house cup they are not i am well aware of our bylaws having written quite a few of them myself however as head of gryffindor house it is for professor mcgonagall to determine the appropriate action argus argus i everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately everyone except you three shes not dead argus she has been petrified but how she has been petrified i cannot say innocent until proven guilty severus we will be able to cure her argus as i understand it madam sprout has a very healthy growth of mandrake when matured a potion will be made which will revive mrs norris and in the meantime i strongly recommend caution to all theres been another attack it means that our students are in great danger the truth tell them hogwarts is no longer safe it is as we feared minerva the chamber of secrets has indeed been opened again harry and about time too hes been looking dreadful for days pity you had to see him on a burning day fawkes is a phoenix harry they burst into flame when it is time for them to die and then they are reborn from the ashes fascinating creatures phoenixes they can carry immensely heavy loads their tears have healing powers hagriiid relax i do not believe that harry attacked anyone yes no harry i do not think it was you but i must ask you is there something you wish to tell me very well then off you go riddle come it is not wise to be wandering around this late hour tom im afraid they are tom they are true i understand tom but im afraid headmaster dippet may have no choice is there something you wish to tell me very well then off you go good evening hagrid i wonder could we i want it understood cornelius that hagrid has my full confidence well what exactly is it that you want with me calm yourself hagrid if the governors desire my removal i will of course step aside however you will find that help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it you both realize of course that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled therefore it is only fitting that you both receive special awards for services to the school now mr weasley if you would have an owl deliver these release papers to azkaban i believe we want our gamekeeper back harry first i want to thank you harry you must have shown me real loyalty down in the chamber nothing but that could have called fawkes to you and second i sense that something is troubling you am i right harry i see well you can speak parseltongue harry why because lord voldemort can speak parseltongue if im not mistaken harry he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar not intentionally but yes its true you possess many of the qualities that voldemort himself prizes determination resourcefulness and if i may say so a certain disregard for the rules why then did the sorting hat place you in gryffindor exactly harry exactly which makes you different from voldemort it is not our abilities that show what we truly are it is our choices if you want proof why you belong in gryffindor then i suggest you look more closely at this be careful it would take a true gryffindor to pull that out of the hat when the governors learned that arthur weasleys daughter was taken into the chamber they saw fit to summon me back curiously lucius several of them were under the impression that you would curse their family if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place beg your pardon yes voldemort only this time he chose to act through somebody else by means of this fortunately our young mr potter discovered it one hopes that no more of lord voldemorts old schoolthings should find their way into innocent hands the consequences for the one responsible would be severe before we begin the feast let us have a round of applause for professor sprout madam pomfrey whose mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been petrified also in light of the recent events as a school treat all exams have been canceled welcome welcome to another year at hogwarts now id like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast first im pleased to welcome professor rj lupin whos kindly consented to fill the post of defense against the dark arts teacher good luck professor our care of magical creatures teacher has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs fortunately im delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own rubeus hagrid finally on a more disquieting note at the request of the ministry of magic  hogwarts will until further notice play host to the dementors of azkaban until such a time as sirius black is captured the dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds now whilst ive been assured that their presence will not disrupt our daytoday activities a word of caution dementors are vicious creatures theyll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way therefore i must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you it is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving but you know happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light mr filch round up the ghosts tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the fat lady keep moving dear lady who did this to you secure the castle mr filch the rest of you to the great hall thank you very good i didnt really expect him to linger quite remarkable yes many each as unlikely as the next not a single professor inside this castle would help sirius black enter it im quite convinced the castle is safe and im more than willing to send the students to their houses perhaps but for now let him sleep for in dreams we enter a world thats entirely our own let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud aresto momentum no minister over this way thats ling you see over there on the slope ah hagrid good evening id like a cup of tea now now hagrid now come on all right itll be all right scabbers i do miss granger but the word of three 13yearold wizards will convince few others a childs voice however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen mysterious thing time powerful and when meddled with dangerous sirius black is in the topmost cell of the dark tower you know the laws miss granger you must not be seen and you would do well i feel to return before this last chime if not the consequences are too ghastly to discuss if you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared three turns should do it i think oh and by the way when in doubt i find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin good luck minister i really think i should sign as well its such a very long name here we are minister follow me now look there look beyond the rocks professor dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster and all the strawberries over there over there all right how extraordinary i dont think the ministers suggesting you had anything to do with this afterall how could you youve been with us all the time well search the skies if you must minister meanwhile id like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy oh executioner your services are no longer required thank you well did what good night,2106,8.803347280334728,50.2851711026616
mcgonagall,"good evening professor dumbledore are the rumors true albus and the boy do you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this ive watched them all day theyre the worst sort of muggles imaginable they really are this boy will be famous there wont be a child in our world who doesnt know his name welcome to hogwarts now in a few moments youll pass through these doors and join your classmates but before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses they are gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin now while youre here your house will be like your family your triumphs will earn you points any rulebreaking and you will lose points at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup the sorting ceremony will begin momentarily were ready for you now follow me all right will you wait along here please now before we begin professor dumbledore would like to say a few words when i call your name you will come forth i shall place the sorting hat on your head and you will be sorted into your houses hermione granger draco malfoy susan bones ronald weasley harry potter your attention please thank you for that assessment mr weasley perhaps ltd be more useful if i were to transfigure mr potter and yourself into a pocketwatch that way one of you might be on time then perhaps a map i trust you dont need one to find your seats harry potter follow me you wait here professor quirrell excuse me could i borrow wood for a moment please potter this is oliver wood wood i have found you a seeker oh oh my goodness  eexplain yourselves both of you  ms granger be that as it mayit was an extremely foolish thing to do  i would have expected more rational behaviour on your part and i am very disappointed in you ms granger  5 points will be taken from gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment  as for you two gentlemen i just hope you realize how fortunate you are  not many first year students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale  5 pointswill be awarded to each of you  for sheer dumb luck  good evening nothing i repeat nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night  therefore as punishment for your actions 50 points will be taken each and to ensure it doesnt happen again all four of you will receive detention no you heard me correctly mr malfoy  you see as honorable as your intentions were you too were out of bed after hours  you will join your classmates in detention im afraid professor dumbledore is not here  he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and left immediately for london how do you know i dont know how you three found out about the stone but i can assure you it is perfectly wellprotected  now would you go back to your dormitories quietly  what are you talking about mr weasley not today mr weasley but i must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done i will be writing to your families tonight and you will both receive detention could i have your attentionplease right now today we will be transforming animals into water goblets like so one two three vera verto now its your turn who would like to go first ahh  mr weasley one two three vera verto that wand needs replacing mr weasley yes miss granger very well you all know of course that hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw salazar slytherin now three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously one did not salazar slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts he believed magical learning should be kept within allmagic families in other words purebloods unable to sway the others he decided to leave the school now according to legend slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle known as the chamber of secrets though shortly before departing he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school the heir alone would be able to open the chamber and unleash the horror within and by so doing purge the school of all those who in slytherins view were unworthy to study magic well  naturally the school has been searched many times no such chamber has been found the chamber is said to be home to something that only the heir of slytherin can control it is said to be the home of a monster i think hes been petrified madam pomfrey look perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker what can this mean albus what should i tell the staff this is out of my hands potter professor dumbledore will be waiting for you sherbet lemon this match has been canceled silence wood you and your teammates will go to gryffindor tower now potter you and i will find mr weasley theres something the both of you have to see i warn you this could be a wee bit of a shock she was found near the library along with this does it mean anything to either of you could i have your attention please because of recent events these new rules will be put into effect immediately all students will return to their house common rooms by 600 every evening all students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher no exceptions i should tell you this unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught it is likely the school will be closed all students are to return to their house dormitories at once all teachers to the secondfloor corridor immediately as you can see the heir of slytherin has left another message our worst fear has been realized a student has been taken by the monster into the chamber itself the students must be sent home im afraid this is the end of hogwarts thats settled  well leave you to deal with the monster gilderoy your skills after all are legend ginny weasley could i have your attention please remember these visits to hogsmeade village are a privilege should your behavior reflect poorly on the school that privilege shall not be extended again no permission form signed no visiting the village thats the rule potter i cant only a parent or a guardian can sign since i am neither it would be inappropriate im sorry potter thats my final word cornelius professor dumbledore doesnt want dementors around the place years ago when harry potters parents realized they were marked for death remember they hid few knew where they were one who did was sirius black and he told youknowwho little lump of a boy always trailing after black peter tried to warn the potters and might have had he not run into an old friend sirius black yes sirius black may not have put his hands to the potters but hes the reason theyre dead this sirius black was and remains to this day harry potters godfather little lump of a boy always trailing after sirius black",1234,8.118421052631579,51.13452188006483

harry harry potter the what well take the lot bertie botts every flavor beans these arent real frogs are they ive got dumbledore hey hes gone just a little bit yeah hey hagrid i think i can tell the wrong sort for myself thanks nothing nothing im fine not slytherin not slytherin say percy whos that teacher talking to professor quirrell whats he teach i think she fancies you we got lost i dont know sir i dont know sir clearly hermione knows seems a pity not to ask her whats seamus trying to do to that glass of water can i borrow this thanks hey ron somebody broke into gringotts listen believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown gringotts goblins while acknowledging the breach insist nothing was taken the vault in question number 713 had in fact been emptied earlier that very same day thats odd  thats the vault hagrid and i went to give it here malfoy give it here or ill knock you off your broom a century according to mcgonagall but ive never even played quidditch  what if i make a fool of myself ii didnt know who doesnt whats happening lets go this way lets go run quick lets hide through that door its locked and for good reason  guarding something i think so  what are those what was that i like this ball what do i do with it whoa i think were going to need another feather over here professor i think she heard you wheres hermione how could a troll get in hermione  she doesnt know its going into the girls bathroom hermione move whooa whoa whoa  do something anything  hurry up i dont think so  just knocked out   ew troll bogies good of you to get us out of trouble like that mind you she might not have needed saving if you hadnt insulted her im not hungry that explains the blood listen last night im guessing snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog  but he got himself bitten thats why hes limping the day i was at gringotts hagrid took something out of one of the vaults  he said it was hogwarts business very secret thats what the dogs guarding  thats what snape wants but ii never get mail its a broomstick but who a little what happened yes whoa yes whoa whooa who knows  why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on halloween yes but hagrid whatever fluffys guarding snapes trying to steal it exactly nicholas flamel nicholas flamelwhos nicholas flamel knight to e5 happy christmas ron  what are you wearing ive got presents oh  your father left this in my possession before he died it is time it was returned to you use it well some kind ofcloak my bodys gone im invisible there was no name  it just said use it well famous fire eaters 15th century fiendsflamel nicholas flamelwhere are you mum dad  ron youve really got to see this  ron youve got to see this  ron ron come on get out of bed theres something youve got to see  now come on come on come come look its my parents look in properly go on  stand there there  you see them dont you  thats my dad how can it  both my parents are dead no no so then it shows us what we want  whatever we want malfoy i found him go on i knew the name sound familiar i read it on the train that day  shh hagrid we think snapes trying to steal it hagrid we know hes after the stone  we just dont know why what wait a minute one of the teachers uh hagrid what exactly is that norbert malfoy hagrid always wanted a dragon  he told me so the first time i met him i dont understand  50  hagrid whats that if i didnt know better draco id say you were scared what is it fang but what was that thing you saved me from but who would choose such a life  do you mean to saythat that thing that killed the unicorn that was drinking its bloodthat was voldemort the sorcerers stone but hes weak  hes living off the unicorns  dont you see we had it wrong  snape doesnt want the stone for himself he wants the stone for voldemort  with the elixir of life voldemort will be strong again  hell hell come back   i think if hed had the chance he might have tried to kill me tonight my scar it keeps burning not like this  i think its a warning  it means dangers coming uhh   oh of course dont you think its a bit odd that what hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one i mean how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets  why didnt i see it before  hagrid who gave you the dragon egg  what did he look like the stranger though you and he must have talked  and did he seem interested in fluffy  we have to see professor dumbledore immediately hes gone now  but this is important  its aboutthe sorcerers stone someones going to try and steal it that was no stranger hagrid met in the village  it was snape which means he knows how to get past fluffy we go down the trapdoor tonight trevor now neville listen we were  lets go sorry snoring snapes already been here  hes put a spell on the harp we have to move its paw come on okay push  ill go first  dont follow

seen spiders act like that oh no its filchs cat its mrs norris no no its not true sir i swear i never touched mrs norris when i said i wasnt hungry we were heading back to the common room when we found mrs norris strange do you think i should have told them dumbledore and the others i mean if there really is a chamber of secrets and it has been opened that means  maybe rons right hermione i mean look at his family the whole lot of them have been in slytherin for centuries how long will it take to make a month but hermione if malfoy is the heir of slytherin he could attack half the muggleborns in the school by then wood look out thank you no i think my arm is broken no not you dobby it was you  you stopped the barrier from letting ron and me through you nearly got ron and me expelled your bludger you made that bludger chase after me you better clear off before my bones come back dobby or i might strangle you i dont suppose you could tell me why youre trying to kill me why

you tell me excuse me  could you tell me whats going on here are you tom riddle hello can you hear me dumbledore hagrid haagriiid wow it was hagrid  hagrid opened the chamber of secrets 50 years ago the monster had killed somebody ron what would any of us have done whats that youve got hagrid and they found it tom riddles diary is gone no weve got to talk to hagrid ron i cant believe its him but if he did set the monster loose last time hell know how to get inside the chamber of secrets thats a start i think its time to get my dads old cloak out again whats that for hagrid are you okay did you hear about hermione look we have to ask you something do you know whos opened the chamber of secrets look come on come on fang come on you heard what hagrid said follow the spiders shush come on dont panic were friends of hagrids and you youre aragog arent you hes in trouble up at the school there have been attacks they think its hagrid they think he opened the chamber of secrets like before

lets go arania exumai go arania exumai dont mention it get us out of here now come on come on move faster come on go get us in the air come on pull we know one thing hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets he was innocent wish you were here hermione we need you now more than ever ron this is why hermione was in the library the day she was attacked come on of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land none is more deadly than the basilisk capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpents eye spiders flee before it ron this is it the monster in the chamber of secrets is a basilisk thats why i can hear it speak its a snake because no one did look it in the eye not directly at least colin saw it through his camera justin justin must have seen the basilisk through nearly headless nick nick got the full blast of it but hes a ghost he couldnt die again and hermione had the mirror i bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along the water there was water on the floor that night she only saw the basilisks reflection spiders flee before it it all fits hermiones answered that too remember what aragog said about that girl 50 years ago she died in a bathroom what if she never left lockhart may be useless but hes going to try and get into the chamber at least we can tell him what we know professor we have some information for you are you going somewhere youre running away after all you did in your books you wrote them youre a fraud youve been taking credit for what other wizards have done dont even think about it to ask you how you died who was it myrtle just like that how this is it this is it ron i think this is the entrance to the chamber of secrets yes there is you first all right lets go thanks

out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading of course here it is  nicholas flamel is the only known maker of the philosophers stone honestly dont you two read  the philosophers stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers  it will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal it means youll never die the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicholas flamel the noted alchemist who last year celebrated his 665th birthday thats what fluffys guarding on the 3rd floor  thats whats under the trapdoor the philosophers stone of course there are other things defending the stone arent there spells and enchantments is thata dragon is that bad well thats good isnt it  hell be with his own kind harry you mean youknowwhos

and bravery  and harry just be careful never better were tied with slytherin come on harry feels strange to be going home doesnt it harry hagrid its so good to see you what did you do to your glasses oculus reparo okay bye come on everyones been so worried fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself mandrake or mandragora is used to return those who have been petrified to their original state its also quite dangerous  the mandrakes cry is fatal to anyone who hears it get off me immobulus at least no one on the gryffindor team had to buy their way in they got in on pure talent you okay ron say something he called me a mudblood it means dirty blood mudbloods a foul name for someone whos muggleborn someone with nonmagic parents someone like me its not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation harry voice what voice harry wait not so fast the chamber of secrets has been opened 
enemies of the heir beware enemies of the heir beware its written in blood thats why ron and i went looking for him professor wed just found him when he said its a bit strange isnt it you hear this voice a voice only you can hear and then mrs norris turns up petrified its just strange no harry even in the wizarding world hearing voices isnt a good sign professor i was wondering if you could tell us about the chamber of secrets muggleborns professor what exactly does legend tell us lies within the chamber yes couldnt you tell  mcgonagalls worried  all the teachers are the heir of slytherin has returned to hogwarts  the question is who is it if youre talking about malfoy i heard him but malfoy the heir of slytherin even they arent that thick but there might be another way mind you it would be difficult not to mention wed be breaking about 50 school rules and itll be dangerous very dangerous here it is the polyjuice potion properly brewed the polyjuice potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another yes  exactly but its tricky  ive never seen a more complicated potion a month i know but its the only plan weve got no even with a proper wand its too risky you could hit harry lets go finite incantatem are you okay you will be able to wont you again you mean the chamber of secrets has been opened before maybe well have to wait for the polyjuice potion to know for sure no no one ever comes in here moaning myrtle moaning myrtle shes a little sensitive do you think hes all right you can talk to snakes no they cant its not a very common gift harry this is bad i dont know but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something harry listen to me theres a reason the symbol of slytherin house is a serpent salazar slytherin was a parselmouth he could talk to snakes too he lived a thousand years ago for all we know you could be everythings set  we just need a bit of who youre changing into we also need to make sure that the real crabbe and goyle cant burst in on us while were interrogating malfoy ive got it all worked out i filled these with a simple sleeping draught simple but powerful now once theyre asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs and put on their uniforms ive already got mine millicent bulstrode slytherin i got this off her robes im going to go check on the polyjuice potion make sure that crabbe and goyle find these well have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves add the hairs cheers me too ii dont think im going you go on without

snape,there will be no foolish wandwaving or silly incantations in this class as such i dont expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potionmaking however for those select few who possess the predisposition i can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses i can tell you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper in death then again maybe some of you have come to hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention mr potter our new celebrity tell me what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood you dont know well lets try again where mr potter would you look if i asked you to find me a bezoar and what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane pity clearly fame isnt everything is it mr potter silence put your hand down you silly girl for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of the living dead a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite well why arent you all copying this down and gryffindors note that five points will be taken from your house for your classmates cheek good luck today potter  then again now that youve proven yourself against a troll a little game of quidditch should be easy work for youeven if it is against slytherin what oh you dont want me as your enemy quirrell you know perfectly well what i mean  well have another chat soon when youve had time to decide where your loyalties lie  good afternoon  now what would three young gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this you want to be careful people will think youre up to something you were seen by no less than seven muggles do you have any idea how serious this is you have risked the exposure of our world not to mention the damage you inflicted on a whomping willow thats been on these grounds since before you were born silence i assure you that were you in slytherin and your fate rested with me  the both of you would be on the train home tonight as it is headmaster these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry if i might headmaster perhaps potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time however the circumstances are suspicious i for one dont recall seeing potter at dinner yes miss granger expelliarmus perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells professor weasleys wand causes devastation with the simplest spells well be sending potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox might i suggest someone from my own house malfoy perhaps dont move potter ill get rid of it for you vipera evanesca a girl has been snatched by the monster lockhart  your moment has come at last werent you saying just last night that youve known all along where the entrance to the chamber of secrets is ive done the dungeons no sign of black nor anywhere else in the castle remarkable feat dont you think to enter hogwarts castle on

tom riddle,professor dumbledore yes professor i suppose i i had to see for myself if the rumors were true about the school as well i dont have a home to go to they wouldnt really close hogwarts would they professor sir if it all stopped if the person responsible was caught no sir nothing good night sir evening hagrid im going to have to turn you in hagrid i dont think you meant it to kill anyone the dead girls parents will be here tomorrow  the least hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered monsters dont make good pets hagrid now stand aside stand aside hagrid cistem aperio arania exumai i cant let you go theyll have your wand for this hagrid youll be expelled she wont wake shes still alive but only just a memory preserved in a diary for 50 years it wont come until its called you wont be needing it im afraid i cant do that you see as poor ginny grows weaker i grow stronger yes harry it was ginny weasley who opened the chamber of secrets it was ginny who set the basilisk on the mudbloods and filchs cat ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls because i told her to youll find i can be very persuasive not that she knew what she was doing she was shall we say in a kind of trance still the power of the diary began to scare her she tried to dispose of it in the girls bathroom and then who should find it but you the very person i was most anxious to meet i knew i had to talk to you meet you if i could so i decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf hagrid to gain your trust it was my word against hagrids only dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that  i knew it wouldnt be safe to open the chamber again while i was at school so i decided to leave behind a diary preserving my 16yearold self in its pages so that one day i would be able to lead another to finish salazar slytherins noble work havent i told you killing mudbloods doesnt matter to me anymore for many months now my new target has been you how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time how did you escape with nothing but a scar while lord voldemorts powers were destroyed voldemort is my past present and future surely you didnt think i was going to keep my filthy muggle fathers name no i fashioned myself a new name a name i knew wizards everywhere would fear to speak when i became the greatest sorcerer in the world dumbledores been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me so this is what dumbledore sends his great defender a songbird and an old hat lets match the power of lord voldemort heir of salazar slytherin against the famous harry potter parseltongue wont save you now potter  it only obeys me no your bird may have blinded the basilisk but it can still hear you yes potter the process is nearly complete in a few minutes ginny weasley will be dead and i will cease to be a memory lord voldemort will return very much alive remarkable isnt it how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body id guess you have little more than a minute to live youll be with your dear mudblood mother soon harry funny the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly little girl what are you doing stop no,640,9.142857142857142,50.15625

lupin,here eat this itll help its all right its chocolate it was a dementor  one of the guards of azkaban its gone now it was searching the train for sirius black if youll excuse me i need to have a little word with the driver eat youll feel better intriguing isnt it would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside very good mr thomas now can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like so terrifying yes yes yes luckily a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart lets practice it now without wands please after me riddikulus very good a little louder and very clear listen riddikulus very good so much for the easy part  you see the incantation alone is not enough what really finishes a boggart is laughter you need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing  let me explain neville would you join me please come on dont be shy come on come on hello neville what frightens you most of all sorry professor snape yes frightens all you live with your grandmother no it wont i want you to picture her clothes only her clothes very clearly in your mind we dont need to hear as long as you see it well see it now when i open that wardrobe heres what i want you to do excuse me imagine professor snape in your grandmothers clothes can you do that yes wand at the ready one two three think neville think wonderful neville wonderful incredible okay to the back neville everyone form a line form a line i want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny next ron concentrate face your fear be brave wand at the ready ron yes you see very good very good marvelous absolutely very very enjoyable parvati next show us what you see keep your nerve steady and next step up step up wonderful wonderful here riddikulus right sorry about that thats enough for today collect your books from the back thats the end of the lesson thank you sorry sorry you can have too much of a good thing you want to know why i stopped you facing that boggart yes i thought itd be obvious i assumed it would take the shape of lord voldemort im very impressed that suggests what you fear the most is fear itself this is very wise dementors force us to relive our very worst memories our pain becomes their power the very first time i saw you harry i recognized you immediately not by your scar by your eyes theyre your mother lilys yes oh yes i knew her your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman she had a way of seeing the beauty in others even and most especially when that person could not see it in themselves and your father james on the other hand he he had a certain shall we say talent for trouble a talent rumor has it he passed on to you youre more like them than you know harry in time youll come to see just how much im sorry to hear about your broomstick is there no chance of fixing it listen dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth they feed on every good feeling every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences you are not weak harry dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine you have nothing to be ashamed of well id consider you a fool if you werent there was only one that night i dont pretend to be an expert harry but as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you perhaps i should teach you but after the holidays for now i need to rest harry there you are you came are you sure about this harry this is very advanced magic well beyond the ordinary wizarding level well everythings prepared the spell im going to try yo teach you is called the patronus charm did you ever hear of it no wella patronus is a positive force for the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield with the dementor feeding on it rather than him but in order for it to work you need to think of a memory not just any memory a very happy memory a very powerful memory can you do this very well close your eyes concentrate explore your past do you have a memory allow it to fill you up lose yourself within it then speak the incantation expecto patronum very good here we go come on sit up deep breaths its all right i didnt expect you to do it the first time that would have been remarkable here eat this youll feel better oh no no no that was a boggart harry a boggart the real thing would be worse much much worse as a matter of interest what were you thinking which memory did you choose thats not good enough not nearly good enough is it strong then lets give it a try you feel ready yes well done harry well done yes sit down here eat this it helps it really helps and just so you know harry i think youd have given your father a run for his money and that is saying something professor harry are you all right i seriously doubt it severus it looks as though its a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it i suspect its a zonko product nevertheless i shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess it is after all as you say my area of expertise harry would you come with me please professor good night come in i havent the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly i am astounded that you didnt hand it in did it never occur to you that this in the hands of sirius black is a map to you no your father never set much store by the rules either but he and your mother gave their lives to save yours gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them now i will not cover up for you again do you hear me i want you to return to your dormitory and stay there and dont take any detours if you do i shall know oh really and who might that be thats not possible expelliarmus well well sirius looking rather ragged arent we finally the flesh reflects the madness within i know i understand how long have you known well hermione you are the brightest witch of your age ive ever met wait very well kill him but wait one more minute harry has the right to know why no it wasnt him somebody did betray your parents somebody who until quite recently i believed to be dead severus severus dont be a fool sirius be quiet severus please he was at school with us we thought he was our friend no he didnt i thought so too until you mentioned pettigrew on the map you sold james and lily to voldemort harry this man get away from her immobulus hello harry i saw you coming ive looked worse believe me no no i resigned actually well it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition this time tomorrow the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well someone like me teaching their children dumbledore has already risked enough on my behalf besides people like me are well lets just say that im used to it by now why do you look so miserable harry didnt make any difference harry it made all the difference in the world you uncovered the truth you saved an innocent man from a terrible fate it made a great deal of difference if i am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year now since i am no longer your teacher i feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you so now ill say goodbye harry i feel sure well meet again sometime until then mischief managed,1431,6.913043478260869,50.3843466107617
